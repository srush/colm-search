10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#1: Multi-hop Question Answering under Temporal Knowledge Editing,Poster #1,"Multi-hop question answering (MQA) under knowledge editing (KE) has garnered significant attention in the era of large language models. However, existing models for MQA under KE exhibit poor performance when dealing with questions containing explicit temporal contexts. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, namely TEMPoral knowLEdge augmented Multi-hop Question Answering (TEMPLE-MQA). Unlike previous methods, TEMPLE-MQA first constructs a time-aware graph (TAG) to store edit knowledge in a structured manner. Then, through our proposed inference path, structural retrieval, and joint reasoning stages, TEMPLE-MQA effectively discerns temporal contexts within the question query. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TEMPLE-MQA significantly outperforms baseline models. Additionally, we contribute a new dataset, namely TKEMQA, which serves as the inaugural benchmark tailored specifically for MQA with temporal scopes.",,,"Keyuan Cheng, Gang Lin, Haoyang Fei, Yuxuan Zhai, Lu Yu, Muhammad Asif Ali, Lijie Hu, Di Wang",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#2: Handling Open-Vocabulary Constructs in Formalizing Specifications: Retrieval Augmented Parsing with Expert Knowledge,Poster #2,"We study the problem of Open-vocabulary constructs (OVCs), ones that are not known beforehand, in the context of converting natural
language (NL) specification sentences into formal languages (e.g., LTL or code).  Models tend to fare poorly on such OVCs, since they do
not have the necessary knowledge a priori.  In such settings, a domain expert can provide the correct constructs based on their
preference or domain knowledge at inference time. Our goal is to effectively reuse this inference-time, expert-provided knowledge in future specification sentences without having to retrain the model.  To this end, we first present a new parsing setting---\emph{dynamic knowledge-augmented parsing} (DKAP)---where, in addition to the input sentence, the model is given (dynamically growing) expert knowledge in the form of a key-value lexicon that associates NL phrases with correct OVC constructs.  To address the DKAP problem, we propose ROLex, a retrieval-augmented parsing approach that uses the dynamic expert lexicon.  ROLex consists of a retriever and a generator that are trained to find and use the relevant subset of the key-value store to produce the correct parse. One key challenge in realizing this solution is the lack of training data for the retrieval-augmented parsing.  We show how we can make use of synthetic data generation, along with original task-level training data---i.e., the (NL sentence, FL statement) pairs---to carry out the requisite training for the retrieval-augmented parsing setting. Further, to improve training effectiveness, we have devised multiple strategies for focusing the model on the relevant subset of retrieved knowledge. Finally, we introduce a new evaluation paradigm designed to address the DKAP problem by simulating the dynamic expert-provided knowledge in three different formalization settings (NL2LTL, NL2Code, and NL2CMD). Our evaluations show that DKAP is a difficult challenge, and ROLex helps improve the performance of baseline models by using dynamic expert knowledge effectively.",,,"Mohammad Saqib Hasan, Sayontan Ghosh, Dhruv Verma, Geoff Kuenning, Erez Zadok, Scott Smolka, Niranjan Balasubramanian",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#3: An In-Context Learning Agent for Formal Theorem-Proving,Poster #3,"We present an in-context learning agent for formal theorem-proving in environments like Lean and Coq. Current state-of-the-art models for the problem are finetuned on environment-specific proof data. By contrast, our approach, called COPRA, repeatedly asks a high-capacity, general-purpose large language model (GPT-4) to propose tactic applications from within a stateful backtracking search. Proposed tactics are executed in the underlying proof environment. Feedback from the execution is used to build the prompt for the next model query, along with selected information from the search history and lemmas retrieved from an external database. We evaluate our implementation of COPRA on the miniF2F benchmark for Lean and a set of Coq tasks from the CompCert project. On these benchmarks, COPRA significantly outperforms few-shot invocations of GPT-4. It also compares favorably against finetuning-based approaches, outperforming REPROVER, a state-of-the-art finetuned approach for Lean, in terms of the pass@1 metric.

10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#4: RAFT: Adapting Language Model to Domain Specific RAG,Poster #4,"Pretraining Large Language Models (LLMs) on large corpora of textual data is now a standard paradigm. 
When using these LLMs for many downstream applications, it is common to additionally incorporate new information into the pretrained model either through RAG-based-prompting, or finetuning. 
However, the best methodology to incorporate information remains an open question. 
In this paper, we present Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT), a training recipe which improves the model's ability to answer questions in ""open-book"" in-domain settings. In training RAFT, given a question, and a set of retrieved documents, we train the model to ignore those documents that don't help in answering the question, which we call, distractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this by citing verbatim the right sequence from the relevant document to help answer the question. This coupled with RAFT's chain-of-thought-style response helps improve the model's ability to reason. In domain specific RAG, RAFT consistently improves the model's performance across PubMed, HotpotQA, and Gorilla datasets, presenting a post-training recipe to improve pre-trained LLMs to in-domain RAG.",,,"Tianjun Zhang, Shishir G Patil, Naman Jain, Sheng Shen, Matei Zaharia, Ion Stoica, Joseph E.

10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#5: Understanding Retrieval Augmentation for Long-Form Question Answering,Poster #5,"How retrieved documents are used in language models (LMs) for long-form generation task is understudied. We present two controlled studies on retrieval-augmented LM for long-form question answering (LFQA): one fixing the LM and varying evidence documents and the other fixing evidence documents and varying the LMs.
We study various attributes of generated answers (e.g., fluency, length, variance), with an emphasis on the attribution of generated answers to in-context evidence documents. We collect a dataset (SALAD) containing human annotations of sentence-level answer attribution in LFQA and evaluate existing methods for automatically judging attribution.
We find that while LMs can leverage relevant in-context documents, the generated answer is only partially attributable towards the documents, especially for LMs trained without retrieval augmentation.
Together, our analysis reveals how retrieval augmentation impacts long knowledge-rich text generation and provide directions for future work.",,,"Hung-Ting Chen, Fangyuan Xu, Shane Arora, Eunsol Choi",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#6: Source-Aware Training Enables Knowledge Attribution in Language Models,Poster #6,"Large language models (LLMs) learn a vast amount of knowledge during pretraining, but they are often oblivious to the source(s) of such knowledge. We investigate the problem of intrinsic source citation, where LLMs are required to cite the pretraining source supporting a generated response. Intrinsic source citation can enhance LLM transparency, interpretability, and verifiability. To give LLMs such ability,
we explore source-aware training---a recipe that involves (i) training the LLM to associate unique source document identifiers with the knowledge in each document, followed by (ii) an instruction-tuning stage to teach the LLM to cite a supporting pretraining source when prompted. Source-aware training borrows from existing pretraining/fine-tuning frameworks and requires minimal changes to the model architecture or implementation. Through experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that our training recipe can enable faithful attribution to the pretraining data without a substantial impact on the model's perplexity compared to standard pretraining. Our findings also highlight the importance of pretraining data augmentation in achieving attribution.",,,"Muhammad Khalifa, David Wadden, Emma Strubell, Honglak Lee, Lu Wang, Iz Beltagy, Hao Peng",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#7: Unveiling LLMs: The Evolution of Latent Representations in a Dynamic Knowledge Graph,Poster #7,"Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate an impressive capacity to recall a vast range of factual knowledge. 
However, understanding their underlying reasoning and internal mechanisms in exploiting this knowledge remains a key research area.
This work unveils the factual information an LLM represents internally for sentence-level claim verification.
We propose an end-to-end framework to decode factual knowledge embedded in token representations from a vector space to a set of ground predicates, showing its layer-wise evolution using a dynamic knowledge graph.
Our framework employs activation patching, a vector-level technique that alters a token representation during inference, to extract encoded knowledge.
Accordingly, we neither rely on training nor external models.
Using factual and common-sense claims from two claim verification datasets, we showcase interpretability analyses at local and global levels.
The local analysis highlights entity centrality in LLM reasoning, from claim-related information and multi-hop reasoning to representation errors causing erroneous evaluation.
On the other hand, the global reveals trends in the underlying evolution, such as word-based knowledge evolving into claim-related facts.
By interpreting semantics from LLM latent representations and enabling graph-related analyses, this work enhances the understanding of the factual knowledge resolution process.",,,"Marco Bronzini, Carlo Nicolini, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano, Andrea Passerini",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#8: From Strategic Narratives to Code-Like Cognitive Models: An LLM-Based Approach in A Sorting Task,Poster #8,"One of the goals of Cognitive Science is to understand the cognitive processes underlying human behavior. Traditionally, this goal has been approached by analyzing simple behaviors, such as choices and response times, to try to indirectly infer mental processes. However, a more direct approach is to simply ask people to report their thoughts - for example, by having them Introspect after the fact about the thought processes they used to complete a task. However, the data generated by such verbal reports have been hard to analyze, and whether the reported thoughts are an accurate reflection of the underlying cognitive processes has been difficult to test. Here we take a first stab at addressing these questions by using large language models to analyze verbally reported strategies in a sorting task. In the task, participants sort lists of pictures with unknown orders by pairwise comparison. After completing the task, participants wrote a description of their strategy for completing the task. To test whether these strategy descriptions contained information about peoples actual strategies, we compared their choice behavior with their descriptions of the task. First, we compared the descriptions and choices at the level of strategy, finding that people who used similar sorting algorithms (based on their choices) provided similar verbal descriptions (based on the embeddings of these descriptions in the LLM). Next, we generated code based on their strategy descriptions using GPT-4-Turbo and compared the simulated behaviors from the code to their actual choice behavior, showing that the LLM-generated code predicts choice more accurately than chance other, more stringent, controls. Finally, we also compare the simulated behaviors of generated codes with those from standard algorithms and induct the strategies that this code internally represents. In sum, our study offers a novel approach to modeling human cognitive processes by building code-like cognitive models from introspections, shedding light on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences.",,,"Hanbo Xie, Hua-Dong Xiong, Robert Wilson",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#9: Model Autophagy Analysis to Explicate Self-consumption within Human-AI Interactions,Poster #9,"The increasing significance of large models and their multi-modal variants
in societal information processing has ignited debates on social safety and
ethics. However, there exists a paucity of comprehensive analysis for: (i)
the interactions between human and artificial intelligence systems, and
(ii) understanding and addressing the associated limitations. To bridge
this gap, we present Model Autophagy Analysis for large models selfconsumption explanation. We employ two distinct autophagous loops
(referred to as self-consumption loops) to elucidate the suppression of
human-generated information in the exchange between human and AI
systems. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets, we
evaluate the capacities of generated models as both creators and disseminators of information. Our key findings reveal (i) A progressive prevalence of
model-generated synthetic information over time within training datasets
compared to human-generated information; (ii) The discernible tendency
of large models, when acting as information transmitters across multiple
iterations, to selectively modify or prioritize specific contents; and (iii) The
potential for a reduction in the diversity of socially or human-generated
information, leading to bottlenecks in the performance enhancement of
large models and confining them to local optima.",,,"Shu Yang, Muhammad Asif Ali, Lu Yu, Lijie Hu, Di Wang",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#10: Bring Your Own Data! Self-Sensitivity Evaluation for Large Language Models,Poster #10,"With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ubiquitous deployment in diverse domains, measuring language model behavior on realistic data is imperative. For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot must ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity. Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set. To alleviate these issues in traditional evaluation, we propose a complementary framework for additional self-sensitivity evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-sensitivity evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in-the-wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-sensitivity evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-sensitivity and human-supervised evaluations. The self-sensitivity paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data.",,,"Neel Jain, Khalid Saifullah, Yuxin Wen, John Kirchenbauer, Manli Shu, Aniruddha Saha, Micah Goldblum, Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein",,Sub,

User-Level Differential Privacy for Language Model Fine-Tuning,Poster #11,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for tackling complex tasks across diverse domains, but they also raise privacy concerns when fine-tuned on sensitive data due to potential memorization. While differential privacy (DP) offers a promising solution by ensuring models are almost indistinguishable with or without any particular privacy unit, current evaluations on LLMs mostly treat each example (text record) as the privacy unit. This leads to uneven user privacy guarantees when contributions per user vary. We therefore study user-level DP motivated by applications where it is necessary to ensure uniform privacy protection across users. We present a systematic evaluation of user-level DP for LLM fine-tuning on natural language generation tasks. Focusing on two mechanisms for achieving user-level DP guarantees, Group Privacy and User-wise DP-SGD, we investigate design choices like data selection strategies and parameter tuning for the best privacy-utility tradeoff.",,,"Lynn Chua, Badih Ghazi, Yangsibo Huang, Pritish Kamath, Ravi Kumar, Daogao Liu, Pasin Manurangsi, Amer Sinha, Chiyuan Zhang",,Sub,

We introduce three distinct dynamic collaborator selection schemes, allowing trust-weighted personalized update aggregation: model-similarity-based, prediction-similarity-based and validation-performance-based. To minimize communication overhead, we integrate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and only exchange LoRA model updates. Our protocols, driven by prediction and performance metrics, surpass both FedAvg and local fine-tuning methods, which is particularly evident in realistic distributed scenarios with more diverse local data distributions. The results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing heterogeneity and scarcity of the local datasets.",,,"Nicolas Wagner, Dongyang Fan, Martin Jaggi",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#13: CA-LoRA: Adapting Existing LoRA for Compressed LLMs to Enable Efficient Multi-Tasking on Personal Devices,Poster #13,"Recently, there has been a demand to deploy Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices such as laptops and smartphones. These LLMs have different model variants when handling different tasks. However, personal devices have limited resources and require reduced storage overhead. To address this, there are two key methods available: the first is model compression, which compresses LLMs into smaller sizes; the second is LoRA, which can transfer an LLM to other tasks with very few parameters, avoiding the storage of multiple model variants in multi-task scenarios by only preserving LoRAs.
However, our experiments show that directly combining these two methods yields sub-optimal performance. Considering that the open-source community has already contributed many LoRAs to LLMs, we propose to adapt these existing LoRAs from the LLMs to their compressed version and introduce a Compression-Aware LoRA (CA-LoRA) framework.
We incorporate knowledge inheritance and recovery strategies to recover the lost knowledge caused by model compression.
Experiment results demonstrate that CA-LoRA outperforms the vanilla LoRA methods applied to a compressed LLM and achieves comparable performance to the non-compressed LLM with existing LoRA modules. The source code of CA-LoRA is available at https://github.com/thunlp/CA-LoRA.",,,"Weilin Zhao, Yuxiang Huang, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu, Zhengyan Zhang, Kuai Li, Chen Chen, TAO YANG, Maosong Sun",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#14: With Greater Text Comes Greater Necessity: Inference-Time Training Helps Long Text Generation,Poster #14,"Long text generation, such as novel writing and discourse-level translation with extremely long contexts, presents significant challenges to current language models. Existing methods mainly focus on extending the model's context window through strategies like length extrapolation. However, these approaches demand substantial hardware resources during the training and/or inference phases.

Our proposed method, Temp-Lora, introduces an alternative concept. Instead of relying on the KV cache to store all context information, we embeds this information directly into a temporary Lora module. In the process of long text generation, this module is progressively trained with text generated previously. This approach not only efficiently preserves contextual knowledge but also prevents any permanent alteration to the model's parameters given that the module is discarded post-generation.

Extensive experiments on the PG19 language modeling benchmark and the GuoFeng discourse-level translation benchmark validate the effectiveness of Temp-Lora. Our results show that: 1) Temp-Lora substantially enhances generation quality for long text, as indicated by a 13.2\% decrease in perplexity (PPL) on a subset of PG19, and a 29.3\% decrease in PPL along with a 113.2\% increase in BLEU score on a subset of GuoFeng, 2) Temp-Lora is compatible with and enhances most existing long text generation methods, and 3) Temp-Lora can greatly reduce computational costs by shortening the context window. For example, we can ensure a moderate improvement in generation quality (a decrease of 3.8\% in PPL) while enabling a 51.5\%  memory usage reduction and a 60.0\% decrease in latency for inference.",,,"Yan Wang, Dongyang Ma, Deng Cai",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#15: TriForce: Lossless Acceleration of Long Sequence Generation with Hierarchical Speculative Decoding,Poster #15,"With large language models (LLMs) widely deployed in long content generation recently, there has emerged an increasing demand for efficient long-sequence inference support. However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/tokenonly half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\times$ on our optimized offloading system. Additionally, TriForce performs 4.86$\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference on a single RTX 4090 GPU. TriForce's robustness is highlighted by its consistently outstanding performance across various temperatures.

Recent studies ameliorate the computational costs of LLMs by increasing their activation sparsity but suffer from significant performance degradation on downstream tasks.
In this work, we introduce a new framework for sparsifying the activations of LLMs and reducing inference costs, dubbed $\underline{C}$ontextually $\underline{A}$ware $\underline{T}$hresholding for $\underline{S}$parsity (CATS).
CATS is a relatively simple algorithm that is easy to implement and highly effective.
At the heart of our framework is a new non-linear activation function.
We demonstrate that CATS can be applied to various models, including Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B \& 13B, and outperforms existing sparsification techniques across multiple tasks.
More precisely, CATS-based models achieve downstream task performance within $\sim$ 99\% of their base models at activation sparsity levels of 50\%, even without any fine-tuning.
Moreover, with fine-tuning that targets only 1\% of the parameters, CATS-based models not only converge faster but also achieve better task performance than competing techniques.
Finally, we develop a custom GPU kernel for the efficient implementation of CATS that translates the activation sparsity of CATS to real wall-clock time speedups.
Our custom kernel implementation of CATS results in a $\sim$15\% improvement in wall-clock inference latency of token generation.

10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#17: Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces,Poster #17,"Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5x higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.",,,"Albert Gu, Tri Dao",,Sub,

It is known transformers prepare information in the hidden states of the forward pass at time step $t$ that is then used in future forward passes $t+\tau$. We posit two explanations for this phenomenon: pre-caching, in which off-diagonal gradient terms present during training result in the model computing features at $t$ irrelevant to the present inference task but useful for the future, and breadcrumbs, in which features most relevant to time step $t$ are already the same as those that would most benefit inference at time $t+\tau$. We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training. In a constructed synthetic data setting, we find clear evidence for pre-caching. In the autoregressive language modeling setting, our experiments are more suggestive of the breadcrumbs hypothesis, though pre-caching increases with model scale.",,,"Wilson Wu, John Xavier Morris, Lionel Levine",,Sub,
10/7/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#20: Does RoBERTa Perform Better than BERT in Continual Learning: An Attention Sink Perspective,Poster #20,"Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can sequentially learn new tasks without forgetting previous tasks' knowledge. Although previous works observed that pre-training can benefit CL, it remains unclear whether a pre-trained model with higher downstream capacity also performs better in CL. In this paper, we observe that pre-trained models may allocate high attention scores to some 'sink' tokens, such as [SEP] tokens, which are ubiquitous across various tasks. Such attention sinks may lead to models' over-smoothing in single-task learning and interference in sequential tasks learning, which may compromise the models' CL performance despite their high pre-trained capabilities. To reduce these effects, we propose a pre-scaling mechanism that encourages attention diversity across all tokens. Specifically, it first scales the task's attention to the non-sink tokens in a probing stage, and then fine-tunes the model with scaling. Experiments show that pre-scaling yields substantial improvements in CL without experience replay, or progressively storing parameters from previous tasks.",,,"Xueying Bai, Yifan Sun, Niranjan Balasubramanian",,Sub,

When combined, many of these strategies have complex interactions regarding the final training efficiency. Prior work tackling this problem did not have access to the latest set of optimizations, such as FlashAttention or sequence parallelism. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study of possible training configurations for large language models. We distill this large study into several key recommendations for the most efficient training.
For instance, we find that using a micro-batch size of 1 usually enables the most efficient training layouts. Larger micro-batch sizes necessitate activation checkpointing or higher degrees of model parallelism and also lead to larger pipeline bubbles.
Our most efficient configurations enable us to achieve state-of-the-art training efficiency results over a range of model sizes, most notably a Model FLOPs utilization of 70.5% when training a LLaMA 13B model.",,,"Johannes Hagemann, Samuel Weinbach, Konstantin Dobler, Maximilian Schall, Gerard de Melo",,Sub,

These issues can limit the model's ability to interpret complex visual information and over-lengthy contextual information accurately. Tackling these challenges is crucial for enhancing the performance and applicability of VLMs. This paper proposes leveraging the ensemble experts technique to synergize the capabilities of individual visual encoders, including those skilled in image-text matching, image segmentation, OCR, etc. This method introduces a fusion network that consolidates the outputs from different visual experts while bridging the gap between image encoders and pre-trained LLMs. In addition, we explore different positional encoding schemes to mitigate the waste of positional encoding caused by lengthy image feature sequences, effectively addressing the issue of position overflow and length limitations. For instance, in our implementation, this technique significantly reduces the positional occupancy in models like SAM, from a substantial 4096 to a more efficient 64 or even down to 1. Experimental results show that VLMs with multiple experts consistently outperform isolated visual encoders, with notable performance improvements as more experts are integrated.

Empowered by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this multi-modal challenge has been brought to a new stage by treating LLMs as few-shot/zero-shot planners, i.e., vision-language (VL) programming.
Such methods, despite their numerous merits, suffer from challenges due to LLM planning mistakes or inaccuracy of visual execution modules, lagging behind the non-compositional models.
In this work, we devise a ""plug-and-play"" method, ExoViP, to correct errors in both the planning and execution stages through introspective verification. We employ verification modules as ""exoskeletons"" to enhance current VL programming schemes. Specifically, our proposed verification module utilizes a mixture of three sub-verifiers to validate predictions after each reasoning step, subsequently calibrating the visual module predictions and refining the reasoning trace planned by LLMs. 
Experimental results on two representative VL programming methods showcase consistent improvements on five compositional reasoning tasks on standard benchmarks. In light of this, we believe that ExoViP can foster better performance and generalization on open-domain multi-modal challenges.",,,"Yuxuan Wang, Alan Yuille, Zhuowan Li, Zilong Zheng",,Sub,

VAs are interviews with a surviving caregiver or relative that are used to predict the decedents COD. Turning VAs into actionable insights for researchers and policymakers requires two steps (i) predicting likely COD using the VA interview and (ii) performing inference with predicted CODs (e.g. modeling the breakdown of causes by demographic factors using a sample of deaths). In this paper, we develop a method for valid inference using outcomes (in our case COD) predicted from free-form text using state-of-the-art NLP techniques. This method, which we call multiPPI++, extends recent work in prediction-powered inference to multinomial classification. We leverage a suite of NLP techniques for COD prediction and, through empirical analysis of VA data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling transportability issues. multiPPI++ recovers ground truth estimates, regardless of which NLP model produced predictions and regardless of whether they were produced by a more accurate predictor like GPT-4-32k or a less accurate predictor like KNN. Our findings demonstrate the practical importance of inference correction for public health decision-making and suggests that if inference tasks are the end goal, having a small amount of contextually relevant, high quality labeled data is essential regardless of the NLP algorithm.",,,"Shuxian Fan, Adam Visokay, Kentaro Hoffman, Stephen Salerno, Li Liu, Jeffrey T.

This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of unique clinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering salient entities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tune open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-$\beta$) on the task and find that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entity coverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities, which are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM to focus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER: Sentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we mark each salient entity span with special ""{{ }}"" boundary tags and instruct the LLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-level planning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitly recording the entities it uses. We fine-tune Mistral and Zephyr variants on a large-scale, diverse dataset of ~167k in-patient hospital admissions and evaluate on 3 datasets.

In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: CLAUDE-3-OPUS significantly outperforms all closedsource LLMs, while the open-source MIXTRAL is on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book.

A salient application is summarization, due to its ubiquity and controversy (e.g., researchers have declared the death of summarization). In this paper, we use financial report summarization as a case study because financial reports are not only long but also use numbers and tables extensively. We propose a computational framework for characterizing multimodal long-form summarization and investigate the behavior of Claude 2.0/2.1, GPT-4/3.5, and Cohere. We find that GPT-3.5 and Cohere fail to perform this summarization task meaningfully. For Claude 2 and GPT-4, we analyze the extractiveness of the summary and identify a position bias in LLMs. This position bias disappears after shuffling the input for Claude, which suggests that Claude seems to recognize important information. We also conduct a comprehensive investigation on the use of numeric data in LLM-generated summaries and offer a taxonomy of numeric hallucination.

However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the $\textit{arXiv}$, $\textit{bioRxiv}$, and $\textit{Nature}$ portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. The statistical framework operates on the population level without the need to perform inference on any individual instance.

In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3\%).

We study the behavior of LMs after fine-tuned on data for a target task (e.g. sentiment analysis) in which the labels have been randomized, a popular unlearning method. While LMs consistently learn to generate near-random predictions for individual training examples in the unlearning set, there is extreme variability across tasks in whether LM predictions change on examples outside the unlearning set. In some tasks (like sentiment analysis), unlearning generalizes robustly, and causes models to generate random outputs on all sentiment-type inputs; in other tasks (like physical commonsense reasoning and scientific question answering) unlearning produces almost no generalization at all, and models continue to perform the task accurately even for examples very similar to those that appeared in the training set. Across tasks, we find that dataset difficulty is not predictive of whether a behavior can be unlearned; instead, generalization in unlearning is (weakly) predicted by the confidence of LMs' initial task predictions and the variability of LM representations of unlearning data, with low confidence and low variability both associated with greater generalization. Finally, we show that even generalizable unlearning is shallow: linear probes trained on LMs' representations can still perform tasks reliably after unlearning.

LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data from the pre-trained model while preserving the model's utilities on other tasks. Several practical methods have recently been proposed for LLM unlearning, mostly based on gradient ascent (GA) on the loss of undesirable data. However, on certain unlearning tasks, these methods either fail to effectively unlearn the target data or suffer from catastrophic collapse --- a drastic degradation of the model's utilities. 

In this paper, we propose \emph{Negative Preference Optimization} (NPO), a simple alignment-inspired method that could efficiently and effectively unlearn a target dataset. We theoretically show that the progression toward catastrophic collapse by minimizing the NPO loss is exponentially slower than GA. Through experiments
on synthetic data and the benchmark TOFU dataset, we demonstrate that NPO-based methods achieve a better balance between unlearning the undesirable data and maintaining the model's utilities. 
We also observe that NPO-based methods generate more sensible outputs than GA-based methods, whose outputs are often gibberish.
Remarkably, on TOFU, NPO-based methods are the first to achieve reasonable unlearning results in forgetting 50\% (or more) of the training data, whereas existing methods already struggle with forgetting 10\% of training data.",,,"Ruiqi Zhang, Licong Lin, Yu Bai, Song Mei",,Sub,

The dominant approach for steering LLMs towards beneficial behavior is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). This involves training a reward model with a human-labeled ranking dataset and fine-tuning the LLM with the reward signal using RL. Despite the fact that the reward is learned from comparing different responses, the RL stage doesn't involve direct comparisons. This inconsistency between reward learning and reinforcement learning stages exacerbates RL's instability. An example would be that the well adopted RL optimizer, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), could perform different gradient updates even for batches with identical human preference information. To address this, we propose a new framework, reinforcement learning with comparative feedback, and a simple policy gradient algorithm, Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O), that learns to improve from direct comparison. Theoretically, P3O has the nice property of being invariant with any reward functions that contain identical preference information, while doesn't require learning a value function. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that P3O can align with human preferences better than existing methods. This suggest that comparative RL is strong candidate for aligning LLM with preference data.",,,"Tianhao Wu, Banghua Zhu, Ruoyu Zhang, Zhaojin Wen, Kannan Ramchandran, Jiantao Jiao",,Sub,

To this end, we propose an offline learning framework that utilizes offline data at scale (e.g, logs of human interactions) to improve LLM-powered policies without fine-tuning. The proposed method O3D (Offline Data-driven Discovery and Distillation) automatically discovers reusable skills and distills generalizable knowledge across multiple tasks based on offline interaction data, advancing the capability of solving downstream tasks.

Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible behaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks between unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address this challenge but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We propose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically compose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov Decision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the control state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that are restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts to the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and web environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM.

In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string --- stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25\% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory.  We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR).

To augment the Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in LLMs, we have developed a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset comprising 1.1 million examples. Utilizing this dataset, we train a series of models, referred to as $\texttt{structlm}$, based on Mistral and the CodeLlama model family, ranging from 7B to 34B parameters.

Furthermore, $\texttt{structlm}$ demonstrates strong generalization across 6 novel held-out SKG tasks, outperforming TableLlama by an average of 35\% and Flan-UL2 20B by an average of 10\%. Contrary to expectations, we observe that scaling model size offers marginal benefits, with $\texttt{structlm}$-34B showing only slight improvements over $\texttt{structlm}$-7B.

Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: list items one by one, which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric order of tags. By integrating our synthetic dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on seven MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of ``list items one by one'' as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage.

A common practice is to label data via consensus annotation over human judgments. However, annotators' judgments for subjective tasks can differ in many ways: they may reflect different qualitative judgments about an example, and they may be mapped to a labeling scheme in different ways. We show that these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, and propose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs. Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanations into an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoring rubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments of the example. The rubric can be designed or modified after annotation, and include distinctions that may not have been known when the original error taxonomy was devised. We explore our technique in the context of rating system outputs for a document-grounded question answering task, where LLMs achieve near-human performance.

Beyond object classification and detection, VLMs are capable of visual comprehension and common-sense reasoning. This naturally led to the question: How do VLMs respond when the image itself is inherently *unreasonable*? To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best performing VLM, achieves 62.99\% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7\% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought). Human evaluation reveals that humans achieve 91.03\% and 100\% accuracy in comprehension and localization. We discover that In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought reasoning substantially degrade the performance of Gemini-Pro on the localization task. Tangentially, we discover a potential weakness in the ICL capabilities of VLMs: they fail to locate optical illusions even when the correct answer is in the context window as a few-shot example.",,,"Haz Sameen Shahgir, Khondker Salman Sayeed, Abhik Bhattacharjee, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Yue Dong, Rifat Shahriyar",,Sub,

Despite this, there has been little work on generating diagrams with T2I models. A diagram is a symbolic/schematic representation that explains information using structurally rich and spatially complex visualizations (e.g., a dense combination of related objects, text labels, directional arrows/lines, etc.). Existing state-of-the-art T2I models often fail at diagram generation because they lack fine-grained object layout control when many objects are densely connected via complex relations such as arrows/lines, and also often fail to render comprehensible text labels. To address this gap, we present DiagrammerGPT, a novel two-stage text-to-diagram generation framework leveraging the layout guidance capabilities of LLMs to generate more accurate diagrams. In the first stage, we use LLMs to generate and iteratively refine diagram plans (in a planner-auditor feedback loop). In the second stage, we use a diagram generator, DiagramGLIGEN, and a text label rendering module to generate diagrams (with clear text labels) following the diagram plans. To benchmark the text-to-diagram generation task, we introduce AI2D-Caption, a densely annotated diagram dataset built on top of the AI2D dataset. We show that our DiagrammerGPT framework produces more accurate diagrams, outperforming existing T2I models.

While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks.
Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks?
To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks.
Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning.
However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities.
Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size.

Computationally, the basic aspects of the conceptualization of a given domain can be represented as Is-A hierarchies in a knowledge graph (KG) or ontology, together with a few properties or axioms that enable straightforward reasoning. We show that even simple ontologies can be used to reveal conceptual inconsistencies across several LLMs. We also propose strategies that domain experts can use to evaluate and improve the coverage of key domain concepts in LLMs of various sizes.

We describe REMEDI, a method for learning to map statements in natural language to fact encodings in an LM's internal representation system. REMEDI encodings can be used as *knowledge editors*: when added to LM hidden representations, they modify downstream generation to be consistent with new facts. REMEDI encodings may also be used as *probes*: when compared to LM representations, they reveal which properties LMs already attribute to mentioned entities, in some cases making it possible to predict when LMs will generate outputs that conflict with background knowledge or input text.

This paradox results from the information asymmetry present in the market, where sellers know more about the quality of their goods than buyers. This work proposes an information market design that leverages language models to mitigate the Buyer's Inspection Paradox by enabling inspection, comparison, and purchase of information, while algorithmically preventing expropriation.

Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings.

Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs,Poster #5,"Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.",,,"Pengda Wang, Zilin Xiao, Hanjie Chen, Frederick L.

However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., ......) in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical conjecture for the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice.

We account for the common practice of validation set reuse and existing small datasets with a stronger random baseline: the expected maximum accuracy across multiple random classifiers. When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized language models applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20% of the few-shot results that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger random baseline. When held-out test sets are available, this stronger baseline is also a better predictor of held-out performance than the standard baseline, avoiding unnecessary test set evaluations.

To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language.
This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem.

In this study, we present a novel cross-lingual vocabulary transfer strategy, trans-tokenization, designed to tackle this challenge and enable more efficient language adaptation. Our approach focuses on adapting a high-resource monolingual LLM to an unseen target language by initializing the token embeddings of the target language using a weighted average of semantically similar token embeddings from the source language. For this, we leverage a translation resource covering both the source and target languages. We validate our method with the Tweeties, a series of trans-tokenized LLMs, and demonstrate their competitive performance on various downstream tasks across a small but diverse set of languages. Additionally, we introduce Hydra LLMs, models with multiple swappable language modeling heads and embedding tables, which further extend the capabilities of our trans-tokenization strategy. By designing a Hydra LLM based on the multilingual model TowerInstruct, we developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model for Tatar, in a zero-shot manner, completely bypassing the need for high-quality parallel data. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-resource languages like Tatar, where high-quality parallel data is hard to come by. By lowering the data and time requirements for training high-quality models, our trans-tokenization strategy allows for the development of LLMs for a wider range of languages, especially those with limited resources.

We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent---in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline.

The challenging decision often centers on whether to use a large LLM with better performance or a smaller one with reduced costs. This has motivated recent research in the optimisation of LLM calls. Either a cascading strategy is used, where a smaller LLM or both are called causally, or a routing strategy is used, where only one model is ever called. This is dependent on a decision criterion in both scenarios which is typically an auxiliary neural model. In this work, we propose a cost-effective solution; we use only the uncertainty of the generations of the small LLM as the decision criterion. We compare our approach with both cascading and routing strategies using three different pairs of pre-trained small and large LLMs, on nine different tasks and against approaches that require an additional neural model.

Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up-to-date information. However, a reported cutoff only scratches the surface. Do all sub-resources in the training data share the same cutoff? Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these sub-resources closely align to their cutoff? We define the notion of an effective cutoff, which is distinct from the LLM's reported cutoff and differs between sub-resources. We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs of an LLM on the resource-level by probing across versions of the data. Crucially, our method does not require access to a model's pre-training data. Through our analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often drastically differ from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal misalignments of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps; and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use these models.",,,"Jeffrey Cheng, Marc Marone, Orion Weller, Dawn Lawrie, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme",,Sub,

This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called  $reverse$ $training$, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities.

To address this shortcoming, we propose V-STaR that utilizes both the correct and incorrect solutions generated during the self-improvement process to train a verifier using DPO that judges correctness of model-generated solutions. This verifier is used at inference time to select one solution among many candidate solutions.

An Investigation into Limitations and Scalability,Poster #23,"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for many AI problems and exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL) capabilities. Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. 
Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question.
In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements. 
We offer theoretical analysis in a simplified setting, explaining that models exhibit compositional capability when the task handles different input parts separately.
We believe our work sheds new light on the capabilities of LLMs in solving composite tasks regarding the nature of the tasks and model scale. Our dataset and code are available at {\url{https://github.com/OliverXUZY/LLM_Compose}}.",,,"Zhuoyan Xu, Zhenmei Shi, Yingyu Liang",,Sub,

Benefiting from ultra-large-scale training corpora, a single LLM can manage typical NLP tasks competently. However, its performance in executing complex tasks is still confined by the limitations of its internal representation. To push this boundary further, we introduce Corex, a suite of novel general-purpose strategies that transform LLMs into autonomous agents, pioneering multi-model collaborations for task-solving. Inspired by human behaviors, Corex is constituted by diverse collaboration paradigms including Discuss, Review, and Retrieve modes, which collectively work towards enhancing the reasoning process. These paradigms foster task-agnostic approaches that enable LLMs to think outside the box, thereby overcoming common errors and providing better solutions. Through extensive experiments across four different types of reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that orchestrating multiple LLM-based agents to work in concert yields better results compared to well-established existing baselines. Further analysis reveals the advantages of Corex over other multi-model methods, synergies produced among different LLMs, and the effectiveness across various aspects.",,,"Qiushi Sun, Zhangyue Yin, Xiang Li, Zhiyong Wu, Xipeng Qiu, Lingpeng Kong",,Sub,

In this work, we present ACORN, a new dataset of 3,500 free-text explanations and aspect-wise quality ratings, and use it to evaluate how LLMs rate explanations. We observed that larger models outputted labels that maintained or increased the inter-annotator agreement, suggesting that they are within the expected variance between human raters. However, their correlation with majority-voted human ratings varied across different quality aspects, indicating that they are not a complete replacement. In turn, using LLMs as a supplement to a smaller group of human raters in some cases improved the correlation with the original majority labels. However, the effect was limited to cases where human raters were scarce, and an additional human rater had a more pronounced effect in all cases. Overall, we recommend against using LLMs as a complete replacement for human raters but encourage using them in configurations that end with targeted human involvement.",,,"Ana Brassard, Benjamin Heinzerling, Keito Kudo, Keisuke Sakaguchi, Kentaro Inui",,Sub,

Next, we define a metric that quantifies the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and human responses, conditioned on country. With our framework, we run three experiments on an LLM trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless with Constitutional AI. By default, LLM responses tend to be more similar to the opinions of certain populations, such as those from the USA, and some European and South American countries, highlighting the potential for biases. When we prompt the model to consider a particular country's perspective, responses shift to be more similar to the opinions of the prompted populations, but can reflect harmful cultural stereotypes.

To support information extraction (IE) for a private call center dataset (AIC), we introduce a human-in-the-loop dialogue generation framework capable of synthesizing realistic dialogues. In IE experiments with AIC dialogues, we observe 25% relative improvement in F1 after augmenting a small set of real human-human conversations with synthetic data. In controlled experiments, we compare training with our human-in-the-loop-synthesized data vs. fully automatically LM-generated data and find that collaborating humans adds value both in the generation and annotation stages.

However, extending these advancements to enable end-to-end speech-to-speech conversation bots remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the extensive dataset and computational resources required. The conventional approach of cascading automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM, and text-to-speech (TTS) models in a pipeline, while effective, suffers from unnatural prosody because it lacks direct interactions between the input audio and its transcribed text and the output audio. These systems are also limited by their inherent latency from the ASR process for real-time applications. This paper introduces Style-Talker, an innovative framework that fine-tunes an audio LLM alongside a style-based TTS model for fast spoken dialog generation. Style-Talker takes user input audio and uses transcribed chat history and speech styles to generate both the speaking style and text for the response. Subsequently, the TTS model synthesizes the speech, which is then played back to the user. While the response speech is being played, the input speech undergoes ASR processing to extract the transcription and speaking style, serving as the context for the ensuing dialogue turn. This novel pipeline accelerates the traditional cascade ASR-LLM-TTS systems while integrating rich paralinguistic information from input speech. Our experimental results show that Style-Talker significantly outperforms the conventional cascade and speech-to-speech baselines in terms of both dialogue naturalness and coherence while being more than 50\% faster.

Preference-based alignment is a widely used paradigm for this purpose, in which preferences over generation pairs are first elicited from human annotators or AI systems, and then fed into some alignment techniques, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization. However, a substantial percent (up to 42%) of the preference pairs used in GLM alignment are noisy, and it remains unclear how the noise affect the alignment performance and how to mitigate their negative impact. In this paper, we propose a framework to inject desirable amounts and types of noise to the preferences, and systematically study the impact of preference noise on the alignment performance in two tasks (summarization and dialogue generation). We find that the alignment performance can be highly sensitive to the noise rates in the preference data: e.g., a 10 percentage points (pp) increase of the noise rate can lead to 30 pp drop in the alignment performance (in win rate). To mitigate the impact of noise, confidence-based data filtering shows significant benefit when certain types of noise are present.  We hope our work can help the community better understand and mitigate the impact of preference noise in GLM alignment.",,,"Yang Gao, Dana Alon, Donald Metzler",,Sub,

Alongside these improvements, however, RLHF also often drives models to produce longer outputs. This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a *purely* length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.",,,"Prasann Singhal, Tanya Goyal, Jiacheng Xu, Greg Durrett",,Sub,

This goal requires the model to provide accurate responses while adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby minimizing hallucinations. To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF).

In RAG, the models knowledge can be updated from documents provided in context. This leads to cases of conflict between the models parametric knowledge and the contextual information, where the model may not always update its knowledge. Previous work studied context-memory knowledge conflicts by creating synthetic documents that contradict the models correct parametric answers. We present a framework for studying such knowledge conflicts in a realistic setup. We update incorrect parametric knowledge using real conflicting documents. This reflects how knowledge conflicts arise in practice. In this realistic scenario, we find that knowledge updates fail less often than previously reported. In cases where the models still fail to update their answers, we find a parametric bias: the incorrect parametric answer appearing in context makes the knowledge update likelier to fail. These results suggest that the factual parametric knowledge of LLMs can negatively influence their reading abilities and behaviors.

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledge interaction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators. We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedical literature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test sets based on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset, we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration of uncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool use and multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, we propose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluate the quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and human assessments. Our experiments yield two key findings:  1) LLMs can generate novel and validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen during training, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions and tool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shot hypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that the integration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use may not always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated.

Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability.

Given a prompt, our erase-and-check method erases tokens individually and inspects the resulting subsequences using a safety filter, declaring it harmful if any of the subsequences are detected as harmful. Our safety filters are implemented by leveraging Llama 2 and DistilBERT. We theoretically demonstrate that our method detects harmful prompts with accuracy at least as high as the safety filter. Additionally, we propose three efficient empirical defenses inspired by our erase-and-check (EC) method: i) RandEC, a randomized subsampling version of erase-and-check; ii) GreedyEC, which greedily erases tokens that maximize the softmax score of the harmful class; and iii) GradEC, which uses gradient information to optimize the tokens to erase.

Traditional coding benchmarks often fail to provide reliable insights into code efficiency, due to their reliance on simplistic test inputs and the absence of effective compound metrics. DPE addresses these issues by focusing on efficiency-demanding programming tasks and establishing an insightful compound metric for performance evaluation. DPE operates in two phases: To curate efficiency datasets, it selects efficiency-demanding tasks from existing coding benchmarks and generates computationally expensive inputs to stress the efficiency of LLM solutions. To assess the code efficiency, DPE profiles the new solution and compares it globally against a set of reference solutions that exhibit distinct efficiency levels, where the matched level defines its efficiency score. As a proof of concept, we use DPE to create EvalPerf, a benchmark with 121 performance-challenging coding tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation draws interesting findings on the efficiency impact of model sizes, instruction tuning, and prompting. For example, while the scaling law fails to account for code efficiency, general instruction tuning benefits both code correctness and efficiency.

Starting from seed instances that GPT-4 fails to answer, we prompt GPT-4 to summarize error patterns that can be used to generate new instances and incorporate human feedback on them to refine these patterns for generating more challenging data, iteratively.
We end up with 8 diverse patterns, such as text manipulation and questions with assumptions. 
We then build a benchmark, SC-G4, consisting of 1,835 instances generated by GPT-4 using these patterns, with human-annotated gold responses.
The SC-G4 serves as a challenging benchmark that allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs' abilities. 
Our results show that only 44.96\% of instances in SC-G4 can be answered correctly by GPT-4. 
Interestingly, our pilot study indicates that these error patterns also challenge other LLMs, such as Claude-3 and Llama-3, and cannot be fully resolved through fine-tuning.

This joint community effort has led to more collaboration, standardization, and overall more progress in language model research. However, one crucial aspect of large language models has been neglected so far: the pretraining datasets. To address this gap, we present an open framework for the collection and systematic compilation of pretraining datasets, called LLM-Datasets. With LLM-Datasets, we make a community-effort and collaborate with experts from the individual languages to collect and systematically compile datasets suitable in terms of data quantity and quality for pretraining language models in a multilingual setting.  The framework provides a unified interface to pretraining datasets enabling the download, text extraction, filtering, and sampling of the pretraining data. It is modular and extensible with new datasets and designed with high-performance-computing requirements in mind that are needed to achieve the scale of today's language models. Users of the framework can focus on the actual data composition and reuse existing datasets from the community while ensuring reproducibility.

Implementing a pipeline solution with these two stages not only introduces complexities (necessitating dual meticulous tuning) but also leads to two occurrences of data distribution shifts, exacerbating catastrophic forgetting.

These language forms, integral to human communication, elude standard LLM comprehension due to their inherent non-compositionality, contextual ambiguity, and sparse representation in text corpora. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach to seamlessly incorporate idiomatic knowledge into pre-trained language models (PTLMs). Our methodology first employs a multi-view data augmentation strategy that uses idiomatic instances representing one property to generate training data for various idiom-related tasks. When combined with a novel parameter-efficient tuning mechanism that accounts for the unique attributes of idiomatic language, we embed task-specific and idiomaticity-aware inductive biases within a PTLM.  Integrating a meta-pretraining protocol based on meta-learning principles, further equips the model with enhanced adaptability to diverse downstream idiom-aware tasks. Empirical validation on diverse benchmarks centered around idiom comprehension and reasoning, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.

Yet, it remains unclear how NTP influences the mapping of linguistic patterns to geometric properties of the resulting model representations. We frame training of large language models as soft-label classification over sparse probabilistic label vectors, coupled with an analytical approximation that allows unrestricted generation of context embeddings. This approach links NTP training to rank-constrained, nuclear-norm regularized optimization in the logit domain, offering a framework for analyzing the geometry of word and context embeddings. In large embedding spaces, we find that NTP implicitly favors learning logits with a sparse plus low-rank structure.  While the sparse component captures the co-occurrence frequency of context-word pairs, the orthogonal low-rank component, which becomes dominant as training progresses, depends solely on the sparsity pattern of the co-occurrence matrix. Consequently, when projected onto an appropriate subspace, representations of contexts that are followed by the same set of next-tokens collapsea phenomenon we term subspace-collapse. We validate our theory on synthetic and small-scale real language datasets.

Training and inference with such models can be costly in practice, which incentivizes the use of smaller counterparts. However, it has been observed that smaller models can suffer from saturation, characterized as a drop in performance at some advanced point in training followed by a plateau. In this paper, we find that such saturation can be explained by a mismatch between the hidden dimension of smaller models and the high rank of the target contextual probability distribution. This mismatch affects the performance of the linear prediction head used in such models through the well-known softmax bottleneck phenomenon. We measure the effect of the softmax bottleneck in various settings and estimate that models based on less than roughly 1000 hidden dimensions tend to adopt degenerate latent representations in late pretraining, which leads to reduced evaluation performance.",,,"Nathan Godey, Éric Villemonte de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot",,Sub,

We then leverage the findings from our investigations to devise a novel approach to dropout for improved model regularization and better downstream generalization.

Recently, a fully-differentiable MoE architecture SMEAR was proposed (Muqeeth et al., 2023), which softly merges experts in the parameter space. Nevertheless, its effectiveness was only demonstrated in downstream ne-tuning on classication tasks. In this paper, we present Lory, a novel approach that scales such architectures to autoregressive language model pre-training. Lory introduces two key techniques: (1) a causal segment routing strategy that achieves high efciency for expert merging operations while preserving the autoregressive nature of language models; (2) a similarity-based data batching method that encourages expert specialization by grouping similar documents in training instances. We pre-train a series of Lory models from scratch on 150B tokens, with up to 32 experts and 30B (1.5B active) parameters. Experimental results show signicant performance gains over parameter-matched dense models in both perplexity (+13.9%) and a variety of downstream tasks (+1.5%-11.1%).

Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promise in modeling the spatial-temporal relationships for predicting environmental variables. However, these approaches often fall short in handling incomplete features and distribution shifts, which are commonly observed in environmental data due to the substantial cost of data collection and malfunctions in measuring instruments. To address these issues, we propose LITE -- a multimodal large language model for environmental ecosystems modeling. Specifically, LITE unifies different environmental variables by transforming them into natural language descriptions and line graph images. Then, LITE utilizes unified encoders to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and correlations in different modalities. During this step, the incomplete features are imputed by a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework, and the distribution shift is handled by incorporating multi-granularity information from past observations. Finally, guided by domain instructions, a language model is employed to fuse the multimodal representations for the prediction.

To uncover the impacts systematically, we construct parametric knowledge graphs to reveal different LLM knowledge structures, and introduce external information through external knowledge distractors of varying degrees, methods, positions, and formats. Experiments on both closed and open-source models demonstrate that LLMs tend to believe in external knowledge sources, particularly when they direct conflict or make confounding changes within detailed contexts.

Recent work has developed techniques for inferring whether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM's internal activations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that at sufficient scale, LLMs *linearly represent* the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also show that simple difference-in-mean probes generalize as well as other probing techniques while identifying directions which are more causally implicated in model outputs.",,,"Samuel Marks, Max Tegmark",,Sub,

Is it merely the outcome of learning syntactic patterns and surface level statistics, or do they extract semantics and a world model from the text? Prior work by Li et al. investigated this by training a GPT model on synthetic, randomly generated Othello games and found that the model learned an internal representation of the board state. We extend this work into the more complex domain of chess, training on real games and investigating our model's internal representations using linear probes and contrastive activations. The model is given no a priori knowledge of the game and is solely trained on next character prediction, yet we find evidence of internal representations of board state. We validate these internal representations by using them to make interventions on the model's activations and edit its internal board state. Unlike Li et al's prior synthetic dataset approach, our analysis finds that the model also learns to estimate latent variables like player skill to better predict the next character. We derive a player skill vector and add it to the model, improving the model's win rate by up to 2.6 times.",,,Adam Karvonen,,Sub,

In this paper, we first investigate the performance of LLMs on complex spatial planning and understanding tasks that require LLMs to understand a virtual spatial environment simulated via natural language and act or reason correspondingly in text. By evaluating on classic spatial planning scenarios through natural language descriptions, we found that current popular LLMs still lack abilities to handle spatial relationships in texts. This arises a question -- do the natural language is the best way to represent complex spatial environments for LLMs, or maybe other alternatives such as symbolic representations are both more efficient and effective for LLMs? To this end, we propose a novel method called CoS (Chain-of-Symbol Prompting) that represents the spatial relationships with condensed symbols during the chained intermediate thinking steps. CoS is easy to use and does not need additional training on LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that CoS clearly surpasses the performance of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting described in natural langauge in all three spatial planning tasks and existing spatial QA benchmark, with even fewer tokens used in the inputs compared with CoT. The performance gain is strong, by up to 60.8% accuracy (from 31.8% to 92.6%) on Brick World scenarios for GPT-3.5-Turbo. CoS also reduces the number of tokens in the prompt obviously, by up to 65.8% of the tokens (from 407 to 139) for the intermediate steps from demonstrations on the Brick World task.

To provide a more comprehensive evaluation of long-context LMs, we create a new synthetic benchmark RULER with flexible configurations for customized sequence length and task complexity. RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context. We evaluate 17 long-context LMs with 13 representative tasks in RULER.

EvoEval: Evolving Coding Benchmarks via LLM",Poster #33,"Large language models (LLMs) have become the go-to choice for code generation tasks, with an exponential increase in the training, development, and usage of LLMs specifically for code generation. To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks. However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety. Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To address this, we introduce EvoEval  a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition.

We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We also find that, when LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to MIAs, this apparent success can be attributed to a distribution shift, e.g., members and non-members are seemingly drawn from identical domain but with different temporal ranges. Finally, we observe that existing MIAs are highly sensitive to even small changes in a sample.

We introduce a practical dataset, *CPHOS-dataset*, including a database, some guiding files, and QA pairs collected from *CPHOS*, which employs an online platform to facilitate the organization of simulated Physics Olympiads for high school teachers and students. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed **CHOPS** architecture using the *CPHOS-dataset*, aiming to demonstrate how LLMs can enhance or serve as alternatives to human customer service.",,,"Jingzhe Shi, Jialuo Li, Qinwei Ma, Zaiwen Yang, Huan Ma, Lei Li",,Sub,

Given the potential risks associated with hallucinations, humans should be able to identify them. This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants ($N=419$) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Results indicate that humans rank content as truthful in the order genuine > minor hallucination > major hallucination and user engagement behaviors mirror this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improves hallucination detection without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.",,,"Mahjabin Nahar, Haeseung Seo, Eun-Ju Lee, Aiping Xiong, Dongwon Lee",,Sub,

While whether and how these biases are mitigated may depend on the specific use cases, being able to effectively detect instances of stereotype perpetuation is a crucial first step. Current methods to assess presence of stereotypes in generated language rely on simple template or co-occurrence based measures, without accounting for the variety of sentential contexts they manifest in. We argue that the sentential context is crucial to determine if the co-occurrence of an identity term and an attribute is an instance of generalization. We distinguish two types of generalizations ---(1) where the language merely mentions the presence of a generalization (e.g., ""people think the French are very rude""), and (2) where the language reinforces such a generalization (e.g., ""as French they must be rude""---, from a non-generalizing context (e.g., ""My French friends think I am rude""). 
For meaningful stereotype evaluations, we need scalable ways to reliably detect and distinguish such instances of generalizations.
To address this gap, we introduce the new task of detecting generalization in language, and build GeniL, a multilingual dataset of over 50K sentences from 9 languages ---English, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, and Portuguese--- annotated for instances of generalizations and their types. We demonstrate that the likelihood of a co-occurrence being an instance of generalization is usually low, and varies across different languages, identity groups, and attributes, underscoring the inadequacy of simplistic co-occurrence based approaches. We also build classifiers that can detect generalization in language with an overall PR-AUC of 58.7, with varying degrees of performance across languages.

The task is question-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough and answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as ""How should you go to Attic from West of House?"" and ""Where are we if we go north and east from Cellar?"". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that even GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them.

In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food.

Recent studies show that syntactic information boosts language model performance and offers clues for people to understand their learning mechanisms. Unlike languages with a fixed word order such as English, Korean allows for varied word sequences, despite its canonical structure, due to case markers that indicate the functions of sentence components. This study explores whether Korean language models can accurately capture this flexibility. We note that incomplete word orders and omitted case markers frequently appear in ordinary Korean communication. To investigate this further, we introduce the Syntactically Incomplete Korean (SIKO) dataset. Through SIKO, we assessed Korean language models flexibility with incomplete syntax and confirmed the datasets training value. Results indicate these models reflect Koreans inherent flexibility, accurately handling incomplete inputs. Moreover, fine-tuning with SIKO enhances the ability to handle common incomplete Korean syntactic forms.

In particular, language model pretraining loss is known to be highly predictable as a function of compute. However, downstream capabilities are far less predictable---sometimes even exhibiting emergent jumps---which makes it challenging to anticipate the capabilities of future models. In this work, we first pose the task of emergence prediction: given access to current LLMs that have random few-shot accuracy on a task, can we predict whether future models (GPT-N+1) will have non-trivial accuracy on that task? We then discover a simple insight for this problem: directly finetuning LLMs on a given task can shift the point in scaling at which emergence occurs towards less capable models. To operationalize this insight, we can finetune LLMs with varying amounts of data and fit a parametric function that predicts when emergence will occur (i.e., ``emergence laws''). To validate this approach, we use four standard NLP benchmarks where large-scale open-source LLMs already demonstrate emergence (MMLU, GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and CoLA). Using only small-scale LLMs, we find that, in some cases, we are able to accurately predict whether models trained with up to 4x more compute have emerged.",,,"Charlie Victor Snell, Eric Wallace, Dan Klein, Sergey Levine",,Sub,

Inspired by these initial studies, we provide a first-ever extensive experiment comparing the in-context few-shot learning capabilities of decoder-only and encoder-decoder models on a broad range of tasks. Furthermore, we propose two methods to more effectively elicit in-context learning ability in seq2seq models: objective-aligned prompting and a fusion-based approach.

However, prompting often leads models to make predictions with lower accuracy compared to finetuning a model with ample training data. On the other hand, while finetuning LLMs on task-specific data generally improves their performance, abundant annotated datasets are not available for all tasks. Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose Self-Guide, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that Self-Guide improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics.

While related work relies on evaluating each candidate model on a set of labeled examples, our new formulation does not assume any labeled data from the new task is available.  Instead, we repurpose a collection of benchmark datasets---which may focus on different tasks than the one at hand---to learn a ''router'' model for  LLM selection from inputs only; this problem reduces to a collection of binary classification tasks.

Unlike conventional methods, which concatenate all demonstration examples with the test instance and prompt LLMs to produce the pointwise prediction, our framework uses the LLM as a preference machine that makes a relative comparative decision between the test instance and each demonstration. A self-supervised method is then introduced to aggregate these binary comparisons into the final ordinal decision. LAMPO addresses several limitations inherent in previous methods, including context length constraints, ordering biases, and challenges associated with absolute point-wise estimation. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate LAMPO's remarkably competitive performance across a diverse spectrum of applications (e.g., movie review analysis and hate speech detection). Notably, in certain applications, the improvement can be substantial, exceeding 20% in an absolute term. Moreover, we believe LAMPO represents an interesting addition to the non-parametric application layered on top of LLMs, as it supports black-box LLMs without necessitating the outputting of LLM's internal states (e.g., embeddings), as seen in previous approaches.",,,"Zhen Qin, Junru Wu, Jiaming Shen, Tianqi Liu, Xuanhui Wang",,Sub,

Our extensive evaluations across a variety of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing tasks show that AdaMoLE exceeds baseline performance. This enhancement highlights the advantages of AdaMoLE's adaptive selection of LoRA experts, improving model effectiveness without a corresponding increase in the expert count.

However, current fusion approaches either rely on learning-based fusers that do not generalize to new LLMs, or do not take into account how well each LLM understands the input. In this work, we study LLM fusion at test-time, which enables leveraging knowledge from arbitrary user-specified LLMs during inference. We introduce Pack of LLMs (PackLLM), an effective method for test-time fusion that leverages each LLMs expertise, given an input prompt. PackLLM performs model fusion by solving an optimization problem for determining each LLMs importance, so that perplexity over the input prompt is minimized. First, our simple PackLLM-sim variant validates that perplexity is a good indicator for measuring each LLMs expertise. Second, our PackLLM-opt variant approximately solves the perplexity minimization problem via a greedy algorithm. The derived importance weights are used to combine the LLMs during inference. We conduct experiments with over 100 total LLMs on a diverse set of tasks. Experimental results show that (i) perplexity is a reliable measure for LLM fusion, (ii) PackLLM outperforms test-time fusion baselines by 1.89% accuracy points, (iii) PackLLM can leverage new LLMs to improve performance over learning-based fusion approaches by 3.9211.94% accuracy points, and (iv) PackLLM benefits over selecting the best or largest model and model merging in certain cases.

As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation.

One common way to evaluate the model response is to rank the candidate answers based on the log probability of the first token prediction. An alternative way is to examine the text output. Prior work has shown that first token probabilities lack robustness to changes in MCQ phrasing, and that first token probabilities do not match text answers for instruction-tuned models. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe.

To handle this, we propose  PairEval, a novel dialogue evaluation metric for assessing responses by comparing their quality against responses in different conversations.  Our metric is built on top of open-sourced and moderate-size language models, and we make them specialized in pairwise comparison between dialogue responses. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our metric exhibits a higher correlation with human judgments than baseline metrics.

Inspired by the use of preference data in RLHF, we formulate the evaluation as a ranking problem and introduce Pairwise-preference Search (PairS), an uncertainty-guided search method that employs LLMs to conduct pairwise comparisons locally and efficiently ranks candidate texts globally. PairS achieves state-of-the-art performance on representative evaluation tasks in long-form generations and demonstrates significant improvements over direct scoring.

However, this setup creates an incentive for the language model to exploit errors in the reward model to achieve high estimated reward, a phenomenon often termed \emph{reward hacking}.
A natural mitigation is to train an ensemble of reward models, aggregating over model outputs to obtain a more robust reward estimate. 
We explore the application of reward ensembles to alignment at both training time (through reinforcement learning) and inference time (through reranking). 
First, we show that reward models are \emph{underspecified}: reward models that perform similarly in-distribution can yield very different rewards when used in alignment, due to distribution shift. 
Second, underspecification results in overoptimization, where alignment to one reward model does not improve reward as measured by another reward model trained on the same data. 
Third, overoptimization is mitigated by the use of reward ensembles, and ensembles that vary by their \emph{pretraining} seeds lead to better generalization than ensembles that differ only by their \emph{fine-tuning} seeds, with both outperforming individual reward models.

However, this is an involved and complex process and direct alignment algorithms, such as DPO have recently emerged as an alternative approach to the classical RLHF pipeline. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy and empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of SFT policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training.

To perform speculative decoding, a small draft model proposes candidate continuations of the input sequence that are then verified in parallel by the base model. One way to specify the draft model, as used in the recent Medusa decoding framework, is as a collection of lightweight heads, called draft heads, that operate on the base model's hidden states. To date, all existing draft heads have been sequentially independent, meaning that they speculate tokens in the candidate continuation independently of any preceding tokens in the candidate continuation. In this work, we propose Hydra heads: a sequentially-dependent drop-in replacement for standard draft heads that significantly improves the accuracy of draft head speculation. We further explore the design space of Hydra head training objectives and architectures, and propose a carefully tuned Hydra head recipe, which we call Hydra++, that improves decoding throughput by up to 1.31x and 2.70x compared to Medusa decoding and autoregressive decoding respectively.

Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. This begs an interesting question: Instead of directly employing LLMs as embodied agents, can we use LLMs reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? In this work, we propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an LLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn different tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description and environment simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items initially given to agents, chances of finding certain objects, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agents performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist game environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We also show that using an LLM to adapt environments dynamically outperforms curriculum learning approaches and how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL agents weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require one or more LLM calls per step (resulting in thousands of LLM calls per episode).

We investigate how LLMs recover from errors in Chain of Thought. Through analysis of error recovery behaviors, we find evidence for unfaithfulness in Chain of Thought, which occurs when models arrive at the correct answer despite invalid reasoning text. We identify factors that shift LLM recovery behavior: LLMs recover more frequently from obvious errors and in contexts that provide more evidence for the correct answer. Critically, these factors have divergent effects on faithful and unfaithful recoveries. 
Our results indicate that there are distinct mechanisms driving faithful and unfaithful error recoveries. Selective targeting of these mechanisms may be able to drive down the rate of unfaithful reasoning and improve model interpretability.",,,"Evelyn Yee, Alice Li, Chenyu Tang, Yeon Ho Jung, Ramamohan Paturi, Leon Bergen",,Sub,
10/8/2024,4:30pm,6:30pm,,#43: Quiet-STaR: Language Models Can Teach Themselves to Think Before Speaking,Poster #43,"When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%10.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%47.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way.",,,"Eric Zelikman, Georges Raif Harik, Yijia Shao, Varuna Jayasiri, Nick Haber, Noah Goodman",,Sub,

But can LMs help us with critical thinking -- thinking in deeper, more reflective ways which challenge assumptions, clarify ideas, and engineer new concepts?
We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs.
We find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap.
Using the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent.

However, no studies have shown that instruction-tuning actually teaches LLMs to process language in a similar manner as humans. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on aligning LLM and human language processing mechanisms in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences, and find that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment (~6%), but has no similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify factors underlying this improvement in brain alignment, we compute correlations between brain alignment and various LLM properties, such as model size, problem-solving, and world knowledge understanding. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that the mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain.",,,"Khai Loong Aw, Syrielle Montariol, Badr AlKhamissi, Martin Schrimpf, Antoine Bosselut",,Sub,

Some have found that just further fine-tuning an aligned model with benign data (i.e., data without harmful content) surprisingly leads to substantial degradation in safety. We delve into the data-centric aspects of why benign fine-tuning inadvertently contributes to jailbreaking. First, we represent fine-tuning data through two lenses: representation and gradient spaces. Additionally, we propose a bi-directional anchoring method that, during the selection process, prioritizes data points that are close to harmful examples and far from benign ones. Our approach effectively identifies subsets of benign data that are more likely to degrade the model's safety after fine-tuning.
Training on just 100 of these seemingly benign datapoints surprisingly leads to the fine-tuned model affirmatively responding to >70% of tested harmful requests, compared to <20% after fine-tuning on randomly selected data. We also observe that the selected data frequently appear as lists, bullet points, or math questions, indicating a systematic pattern in fine-tuning data that contributes to jailbreaking.",,,"Luxi He, Mengzhou Xia, Peter Henderson",,Sub,

In this paper, we investigate an important and unexplored question of whether techniques that successfully jailbreak Large Language Models (LLMs) can be equally effective in jailbreaking MLLMs. To explore this issue, we in- troduce JailBreakV-28K, a pioneering benchmark designed to assess the transferability of LLM jailbreak techniques to MLLMs, thereby evaluat- ing the robustness of MLLMs against diverse jailbreak attacks.

Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney.  This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices (\$0.23 - \$0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Additionally, this approach holds promise as a tool for data augmentation, potentially enhancing machine learning models by providing varied and cost-effective training data.

Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the following question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?"". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities.

To achieve better reasoning with MLLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely explored, which further promotes MLLMs explainability by giving intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the strong power demonstrated by MLLMs in multimodal reasoning, recent studies show that MLLMs still suffer from ad- versarial images. This raises the following open questions: Does CoT also enhance the adversarial robustness of MLLMs? What do the intermediate reasoning steps of CoT entail under adversarial attacks? To answer these questions, we first generalize existing attacks to CoT-based inferences by attacking the two main components, i.e., rationale and answer. We find that CoT indeed improves MLLMs adversarial robustness against the existing attack methods by leveraging the multi-step reasoning process, but not substantially. Based on our findings, we further propose a novel attack method, termed as stop-reasoning attack, that attacks the model while by- passing the CoT reasoning process. Experiments on three MLLMs and two visual reasoning datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Recent works have shown that training with only limited data can show a superior performance on general tasks. However, the feasibility on mathematical reasoning tasks has not been validated. To go further, there exist two open questions for mathematical reasoning: how to select influential data and what is an influential data composition.

For the latter one, we first enlarge our setting and explore the influential data composition.

However, instruction datasets can be expensive and time-consuming to manually curate, and while LLM-generated data is less labor-intensive, it may violate user privacy agreements or terms of service of LLM providers. Therefore, we seek a way of constructing instruction datasets with samples that are not generated by humans or LLMs but still improve LLM generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce Cookbook, a framework that programmatically generates training data consisting of simple patterns over random tokens, resulting in a scalable, cost-effective approach that avoids legal and privacy issues. First, Cookbook uses a template---a data generating Python function---to produce training data that encourages the model to learn an explicit pattern-based rule that corresponds to a desired task.  We find that fine-tuning on Cookbook-generated data is able to improve performance on its corresponding task by up to 52.7 accuracy points. Second, since instruction datasets improve performance on multiple downstream tasks simultaneously, Cookbook algorithmically learns how to mix data from various templates to optimize performance on multiple tasks. On the standard multi-task GPT4ALL evaluation suite, Mistral-7B fine-tuned using a Cookbook-generated dataset attains the best accuracy on average compared to other 7B parameter instruction-tuned models and is the best performing model on 3 out of 8 tasks. Finally, we analyze when and why Cookbook improves performance and present a metric that allows us to verify that the improvement is largely explained by the models generations adhering better to template rules.",,,"Avanika Narayan, Mayee F Chen, Kush Bhatia, Christopher Re",,Sub,

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training.

Each of these procedures may be thought of as invoking a different form of reasoning: instruction following involves deductive reasoning, few-shot prompting involves inductive reasoning, and instruction inference is abductive reasoning. How do these different capabilities relate? Across four LMs (from the gpt and llama families) and two learning problems (involving arithmetic functions and machine translation) we find a strong dissociation between the different types of reasoning: LMs can sometimes learn effectively from few-shot prompts even when they are unable to explain their own prediction rules; conversely, they sometimes infer useful task descriptions while completely failing to learn from human-generated descriptions of the same task.

A typical setup involves (1) defining an auxiliary task consisting of a dataset of text annotated with labels, then (2) supervising small classifiers to predict the labels from the representations of a pretrained LM as it processes the dataset. A high probing accuracy is interpreted as evidence that the LM has learned to perform the auxiliary task as an unsupervised byproduct of its original pretraining objective. Despite the widespread usage of probes, however, the robust design and analysis of probing experiments remains a challenge. We develop a formal perspective on probing using *structural causal models* (SCM). Specifically, given an SCM which explains the distribution of tokens observed during training, we frame the central hypothesis as whether the LM has learned to represent the latent variables of the SCM. Empirically, we extend a recent study of LMs in the context of a synthetic grid-world navigation task, where having an exact model of the underlying causal structure allows us to draw strong inferences from the result of probing experiments.

First, we apply causal tracing or interchange interventions to localize key components inside Mamba that are responsible for recalling facts, revealing that specific components within middle layers show strong causal effects at the last token of the subject, while the causal effect of intervening on later layers is most pronounced at the last token of the prompt, matching previous findings on autoregressive transformers. Second, we show that rank-one model editing methods can successfully insert facts at specific locations, again resembling findings on transformer LMs. Finally we adapt attention-knockout techniques to Mamba in order to dissect information flow during factual recall.

Our method tunes a *smaller* LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the larger untuned model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger-scale pretraining. In experiments, when we apply proxy-tuning to Llama2-70B using proxies of only 7B size, we can close 88% of the gap between Llama2-70B and its truly-tuned chat version, when evaluated across knowledge, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. We then demonstrate the generality of proxy-tuning by applying it to domain adaptation on code, and task-specific finetuning on question-answering and math problems.

To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking.

Additionally, the previous methods suffer from significant accuracy loss under low-bit quantization (2-3 bits). To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Mixed Precision and Low-Rank Quantization Error Reconstruction for LLMs (AMLQ), which achieves state-of-the-art performance under the approximate average bit precision overall. Furthermore, we introduce the low-rank decomposition to reconstruct quantization error based on the output features. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can be effectively combined with various quantization techniques and bring considerable performance gains. Our approach comprehensively considers model performance and inference efficiency, offering more than 3$\times$ speedup over the FP16 execution.",,,"Lin Ou, Jinpeng Xia, Yuewei Zhang, Chuzhan Hao, Hao Henry Wang",,Sub,

However, as context length increases, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory, becoming a bottleneck for deployment.
This paper introduces SKVQ (Sliding-window KV cache Quantization), a strategy designed to address the challenge of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache to enhance channel similarity within quantization groups and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Furthermore, SKVQ maintains high precision for the most recent window tokens in the KV cache, preserving accuracy for a small yet critical portion of the cache.
Our evaluation of LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy, outperforming previous quantization methods. SKVQ enables the quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal accuracy loss. This advancement allows processing context lengths of up to 1M tokens on an 80GB GPU for a 7B parameter model, resulting in up to 7 times faster decoding.",,,"Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng ZHANG, Dahua Lin",,Sub,
10/9/2024,11:00am,1:00pm,,#17: Compression Represents Intelligence Linearly,Poster #17,"There is a belief that learning to compress well will lead to intelligence. Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine the relationship between compression and intelligence in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of ""intelligence"", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that vary in size and originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence --  reflected by benchmark scores -- almost **linearly** correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. This work advocates for the adoption of compression performance as a stable, flexible, and reliable metric for evaluating LLMs. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly.",,,"Yuzhen Huang, Jinghan Zhang, Zifei Shan, Junxian He",,Sub,

These resources enable us to construct and test a range of LM inference methods beyond zero-shot prompting for competitive programming. We find state-of-the-art models in code generation, such as GPT-4, achieve only a 8.7\% pass@1 accuracy with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting, with our best inference method almost \textit{doubling} zero-shot accuracy using a novel combination of retrieval augmentation and self-reflection. However, this is still far from solving the benchmark. To better understand the remaining challenges, we perform a novel human-in-the-loop study, and surprisingly find that a small number of targeted hints enable GPT-4 to solve 13 out of 15 problems previously unsolvable by any model and method.

These debates often hinge on the concept of ""task demands"" -- the auxiliary challenges associated with performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the childs underlying ability. The same issues arise when measuring the capacities of language models (LMs): performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying knowledge, combined with the models ability to interpret and perform the task given its available resources. Here, we show that for analogical reasoning, reflective reasoning, word prediction, and grammaticality judgments, evaluation methods with greater task demands yield lower performance than evaluations with reduced demands. This ""demand gap"" is most pronounced for models with fewer parameters and less training data. Our results illustrate that LM performance should not be interpreted as a direct indication of intelligence (or lack thereof), but as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of researchers' design choices.",,,"Jennifer Hu, Michael Frank",,Sub,

Although LMs can be tuned to improve their adherence to formal syntax, this does not *guarantee* conformance, especially with smaller LMs suitable for large-scale deployment.
In addition, tuning requires significant resources, making it impractical for uncommon or task-specific formats.
To prevent downstream parsing errors we would ideally *constrain* the LM to only produce valid output, but this is severely complicated by tokenization, which is typically both ambiguous and misaligned with the formal grammar.
We solve these issues through the application of automata theory, deriving an efficient closed-form solution for the *regular languages*, a broad class of formal languages with many practical applications, including API calls or schema-guided JSON and YAML.
We also discuss pragmatic extensions for coping with the issue of high branching factor, and extend our techniques to *deterministic context-free languages*, which similarly admit an efficient closed-form solution.
Previous work on this topic (Willard and Louf, 2023) layers bespoke solutions onto automata, leading to problems with speed, correctness, and extensibility.
Instead, we reformulate the entire task in terms of automata so we can leverage well-studied and well-optimized algorithms.

First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- **5 trillion tokens**. This is one of the largest $n$-gram LMs ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new **$\infty$-gram LM** with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with **millisecond-level latency**. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity.

Evaluation on four text generation tasks demonstrate that PPO-MCTS greatly improves the preferability of generated text compared to the standard practice of using only the PPO policy.

Meanwhile, recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their capability in generating layouts and programs to control downstream visual modules. This prompts an important question: can we leverage the knowledge embedded in these LLMs for temporally consistent long video generation? In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation. Specifically, given a single text prompt, we first ask our video planner LLM (GPT-4) to expand it into a video plan, which includes the scene descriptions, the entities with their respective layouts, the background for each scene, and consistency groupings of the entities. Next, guided by this video plan, our video generator, named Layout2Vid, has explicit control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of entities across multiple scenes, while being trained only with image-level annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoDirectorGPT framework substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with consistency, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs in open-domain single-scene T2V generation.

Their full power is better harnessed when the models are coupled with external verifiers and the final solutions are derived iteratively or progressively according to the verification feedback. In the context of embodied AI, verification often solely involves assessing whether goal conditions specified in the instructions have been met. Nonetheless, for these agents to be seamlessly integrated into daily life, it is crucial to account for a broader range of constraints and preferences beyond bare task success (e.g., a robot should grasp bread with care to avoid significant deformations). However, given the unbounded scope of robot tasks, it is infeasible to construct scripted verifiers akin to those used for explicit-knowledge tasks like the game of Go and theorem proving. This begs the question: when no sound verifier is available, can we use large vision and language models (VLMs), which are approximately omniscient, as scalable Behavior Critics to help catch undesirable robot behaviors in videos? To answer this, we first construct a benchmark that contains diverse cases of goal-reaching yet undesirable robot policies. Then, we comprehensively evaluate VLM critics to gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and failure modes.

Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotation or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose A$^\mathbf{3}$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2.

The question design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study.

Revisiting language models' response stability under paraphrasing for the assessment of political leaning",Poster #39,"An increasing number of studies are aimed at uncovering characteristics such as personality traits or political leanings of language models (LMs), using questionnaires developed for human respondents. From this previous body of work, it is evident that models are highly sensitive to prompt design, including the phrasing of questions and statements, as well as the format of the expected response (e.g., forced choice, vs open-ended). These sensitivities then often lead to inconsistent responses. However, most studies assess response stability on a small scale with low statistical power e.g., using less than ten paraphrases of the same question.

In this work, we investigate the stability of responses to binary forced-choice questions using a large number of paraphrases. Specifically, we probe both masked language models (MLMs) and left-to-right generative language models (GLMs) on the political compass test, assessing response validity (i.e., the proportion of valid responses to a prompt) and response stability (i.e., the variability under paraphrasing) across 500 paraphrases of each statement. This large-scale assessment allows us to approximate the underlying distribution of model responses more precisely, both in terms of the overall stability of a model under paraphrasing as well as the stability of specific items (i.e., the intended meaning of a question). In addition, to investigate whether there are structural biases that drive model responses into a certain direction, we test the association between different word- and sentence-level features, and the models' responses.

We find that while all MLMs exhibit a high degree of response validity, GLMs do not consistently produce valid responses when assessed via forced choice. In terms of response stability, we show that even models that exhibit high overall stability scores flip their responses given certain paraphrases. Crucially, even within-model, response stability can vary considerably between items. We also find that models tend to agree more with statements that show high positive sentiment scores.

Based on our results, we argue that human-centered questionnaires might not be appropriate in the context of probing LMs as both their response validity and stability differ considerably between items. Moreover, although stability metrics represent useful descriptions of model properties, it should be emphasized that even for models exhibiting fairly high stability, specific paraphrases can lead to substantially different model responses.",,,"Patrick Haller, Jannis Vamvas, Lena Ann Jäger",,Sub,

Prior measures of bias are sensitive to perturbations in the templates designed to compare performance across social groups, due to factors such as low diversity or limited number of templates. Also, most  previous work considers only one NLP task. We introduce Comprehensive Assessment of Language Models (CALM) for robust measurement of social biases. We use sixteen datasets for question-answering, sentiment analysis and natural language inference and filter them to produce 224 templates with high diversity (e.g., length, vocabulary). This helps us create a novel dataset of 78,400 prompts covering the three NLP tasks. Our empirical evaluation shows that CALM bias scores are more robust and far less sensitive than previous bias measurements to perturbations in the templates, such as synonym substitution, or to random subset selection of templates. We apply CALM to 20 large language models, and find that for 2 LM series, larger parameter models tend to be more biased than smaller ones. The T0 series is the least biased model families, of the 20 LLMs investigated here.",,,"Vipul Gupta, Pranav Narayanan Venkit, Hugo Laurençon, Shomir Wilson, Rebecca J. Passonneau",,Sub,

We introduce a novel approach to synthetically introduce type-written phonological features of AAL into text, a class of AAL features that has been overlooked in prior work. Our goal is to better understand how these features affect generative language models' performance on three tasks: toxicity detection, sentiment analysis, and masked span prediction. We find that fine-tuning with synthetic type-written phonological features lowers perceived biases on downstream tasks and our ablations reveal which features have particularly large negative impacts on model performance.

A recently proposed detoxification method utilizes the task vector obtained by subtraction from the fine-tuned model on toxic datasets to the pre-trained model. This approach has shown effectiveness for detoxification but still suffers from degradation. This study focuses on further mitigating degradation while maintaining detoxification performance. To mitigate the degradation, we propose a method that detoxifies the PLMs by fine-tuning multiple models on split toxic datasets and by merging the subtracted task vectors. 
We conducted experiments on two toxic datasets (Civil Comments and Toxigen) with five PLMs (GPT2-small, GPT2-medium, GPT2-large, Phi-1.5, and Llama2-7b), demonstrating that our method consistently achieves a lower toxicity score while preventing the degradation compared to baseline methods.
Especially, with the GPT2-small model on the Toxigen dataset, degradation was reduced by 38.9\% compared to that of an existing task vector method while maintaining a similar toxicity score.
In addition, we found that merging multiple detoxified models tends to increase the number of parameters that remained almost unchanged from the pre-trained model.
We assume that by merging multiple detoxified models, ""decoupling noise and toxic parameters"" is implicitly achieved. The accidental noise in the parameter shift unrelated to detoxification disappears by averaging noise, whereas the parameter shift associated with detoxification is maintained.
We hope that the findings of this study will be applied not only to detoxification but also to many other research domains that seek to suppress undesirable outputs of language models.",,,"Yongmin Kim, Takeshi Kojima, Yusuke Iwasawa, Yutaka Matsuo",,Sub,

However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, and verbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. \emph{Retrieval-Augmented ICL} methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract semantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields more accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial attacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved data, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models can enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL with a 4.87\% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit overconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2\% increase in ASR for demonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness of ICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be too costly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effective training-free adversarial defence method, \emph{DARD}, which enriches the example pool with those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements in performance and robustness, achieving a 15\% reduction in ASR over the baselines.

In real-world scenarios, retrievers are expected to not only rely on the semantic relevance between the documents and the queries but also recognize the nuanced intents or perspectives behind a user query. For example, when asked to verify a claim, a retrieval system is expected to identify evidence from both supporting vs. contradicting perspectives, for the downstream system to make a fair judgment call.
In this work, we study whether retrievers can recognize and respond to different perspectives of the queries --- beyond finding relevant documents for a claim, can retrievers distinguish supporting vs. opposing documents? We reform and extend six existing tasks to create a benchmark for retrieval, where we have diverse perspectives described in free-form text, besides root, neutral queries. We show that current retrievers covered in our experiments have limited awareness of subtly different perspectives in queries and can also be biased toward certain perspectives. Motivated by the observation, we further explore the potential to leverage geometric features of retriever representation space to improve the perspective awareness of retrievers in a zero-shot manner. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our projection-based methods on the same set of tasks. Further analysis also shows how perspective awareness improves performance on various downstream tasks, with 4.2% higher accuracy on AmbigQA and 29.9% more correlation with designated viewpoints on essay writing, compared to non-perspective-aware baselines.",,,"Xinran Zhao, Tong Chen, Sihao Chen, Hongming Zhang, Tongshuang Wu",,Sub,

In this work we ask what are the desiderata for LLMs when a knowledge conflict arises and whether existing LLMs fulfill them. We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge conflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide distinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we introduce an evaluation framework for simulating contextual knowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve these goals. It includes diverse and complex situations of knowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic conflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing difficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with the framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine the specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers amidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new instruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three goals. Further analysis shows that abilities to tackle knowledge conflicts are greatly impacted by factors such as knowledge domain, while generating robust responses to knowledge conflict scenarios remains an open research question.",,,"Yike Wang, Shangbin Feng, Heng Wang, Weijia Shi, Vidhisha Balachandran, Tianxing He, Yulia Tsvetkov",,Sub,

Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an agent selection algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called Agent Importance Score, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost.

To understand the contexts in which users disclose to chatbots, we develop a taxonomy of tasks and sensitive topics, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of naturally occurring conversations. We discuss these potential privacy harms and observe that: (1) personally identifiable information (PII) appears in unexpected contexts such as in translation or code editing (48% and 16% of the time, respectively) and (2) PII detection alone is insufficient to capture the sensitive topics that are common in human-chatbot interactions, such as detailed sexual preferences or specific drug use habits.

To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that fora fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on5% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal.

Breaking the Curse of Recursion by Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data,Poster #4,"The proliferation of generative models, combined with pretraining on web-scale data, raises a timely question: what happens when future models are trained on model-generated data? Recent investigations answered that such model-data feedback loops cause performance to progressively degrades with each model-data iteration until fitted models become useless, a phenomenon termed model collapse. However, those studies largely assumed that new data replace old data over time, where a more realistic assumption is that data accumulate over time. In this paper, we ask: what effect does accumulating data have on model collapse? 
We first empirically study this question by pretraining sequences of language models on text corpora. After confirming that replacing the original real data by each generation's synthetic data does indeed tend towards model collapse, we demonstrate that accumulating synthetic data with real data avoids model collapse; these results hold across a range of sizes, architectures, and hyperparameters. We obtain similar results for other deep generative models: diffusion models for molecule conformation generation and variational autoencoders for image generation. To understand why accumulating data can avoid model collapse, we use an analytically tractable framework introduced by prior work in which a sequence of linear models are fit to previous models' outputs. Previous work used this framework to show that if data are replaced, the test error increases with the number of model-fitting iterations; we extend this argument to prove that if data instead accumulate, the test error has a finite upper bound independent of the number of iterations, meaning model collapse is avoided.

Our findings reveal that the repeated use of smaller models can yield consistent improvements, with gains of up to 15% across five tasks. On the other hand, in scenarios where unit-tests are unavailable, a ranking-based selection of candidates from the smaller model falls short of the performance of a single output from larger ones.

It is expensive to understand the impact of these domain-specific datasets on model capabilities as training at large FLOP scales is required to reveal significant changes to difficult and emergent benchmarks. Given the increasing cost of experimenting with pretraining data, how does one determine the optimal balance between the diversity in general web scrapes and the information density of domain specific data? In this work, we show how to leverage the smaller domain specific datasets by upsampling them relative to CC at the end of training to drive performance improvements on difficult benchmarks. This simple technique allows us to improve up to 6.90 pp on MMLU, 8.26 pp on GSM8K, and 6.17 pp on HumanEval relative to the base data mix for a 7B model trained for 1 trillion (T) tokens, thus rivaling Llama-2 (7B)a model trained for twice as long.

We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references. To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization.",,,"Jaehun Jung, Ximing Lu, Liwei Jiang, Faeze Brahman, Peter West, Pang Wei Koh, Yejin Choi",,Sub,

In this work, we propose FUSE (Flexible Unification of Semantic Embeddings), an inexpensive approach to approximating an adapter layer that maps from one model's textual embedding space to another, even across different tokenizers. We introduce a third-order tensor-based representation of a model's embedding space that aligns semantic embeddings that have been split apart by different tokenizers, and use this representation to derive an approximation of the gradient of one model's outputs with respect to another model's embedding space. We show the efficacy of our approach via multi-objective optimization over vision-language and causal language models for image captioning and sentiment-based image captioning.",,,"Joshua Nathaniel Williams, J Zico Kolter",,Sub,

Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) has been proposed as a regulariser for training cross-attention in transformers, potentially addressing this domain overfitting problem. We extend the NVIB framework to replace all types of attention functions in transformers. We show that existing pretrained transformers can be reinterpreted as nonparametric variational models using an empirical prior distribution and identity initialisation with controllable hyperparameters. We then show that changing the initialisation introduces a novel, information-theoretic post-training regularisation in the attention mechanism, which improves out-of-domain generalisation on NLP tasks without any additional training. This success supports the hypothesis that the way pretrained transformer embeddings represent information is accurately characterised by nonparametric variational Bayesian models.",,,"Fabio James Fehr, James Henderson",,Sub,

Such documents are extremely important in numerous domains, including science, law or medicine. However, most existing solutions are inefficient and fail to make use of the structure inherent to documents. HDT exploits document structure by introducing auxiliary anchor tokens and redesigning the attention mechanism into a sparse multi-level hierarchy. This approach facilitates information exchange between tokens at different levels while maintaining sparsity, thereby enhancing computational and memory efficiency while exploiting the document structure as an inductive bias. We address the technical challenge of implementing HDT's sample-dependent hierarchical attention pattern by developing a novel sparse attention kernel that considers the hierarchical structure of documents. As demonstrated by our experiments, utilizing structural information present in documents leads to faster convergence, higher sample efficiency and better performance on downstream tasks.",,,"Haoyu He, Markus Flicke, Jan Buchmann, Iryna Gurevych, Andreas Geiger",,Sub,

Operating on bytes, however, results in significantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive Transformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence length. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an appealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient decoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM trained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show MambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art subword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits of token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of efficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized drafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\times$ inference speedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding efficiency as the subword Mamba.

However, the development of these tools requires substantial engineering effort. State-of-the-art approaches use lifting, a technique where source assembly code is translated to an architecture-independent intermediate representation (IR)  for example, the LLVM IR  and use a pre-existing compiler to recompile the IR to the target ISA. However, the hand-written rules these lifters employ are sensitive to the particular compiler and optimization level used to generate the code and require significant engineering effort to support each new ISA. We propose Forklift, the first neural lifter that learns how to translate assembly to LLVM IR using a token-level encoder-decoder Transformer. We show how to incrementally add support to new ISAs by fine tuning the assembly encoder and freezing the IR decoder, improving the overall accuracy and efficiency. We collect millions of parallel LLVM IR, x86, ARM, and RISC-V programs across compilers and optimization levels to train Forklift and set up an input/output-based accuracy harness. We evaluate Forklift on two challenging benchmark suites and translate 2.5x more x86 programs than a state-of-the-art hand-written lifter and 4.4x more x86 programs than GPT-4 as well as enabling translation from new ISAs.",,,"Jordi Armengol-Estapé, Rodrigo C.

We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement.

While recent work, e.g., Reflexion, has demonstrated how such agents can also self-improve by adding a textual memory of ''hints'' learned from prior experience, such improvements have been limited both in size and scope. In contrast, our goal is a language agent that can robustly improve performance over time, including when both the task and environment are varied. Our approach is to have the agent learn a textual representation of how the world works (rather than just isolated hints), expressed as a memory of causal abstractions, to guide future decision-making. In experiments, we find CLIN is able to continually improve on repeated trials on the same task and environment, outperforming state-of-the-art reflective language agents like Reflexion by 23 points in ScienceWorld and 1.4 points in ALFWorld benchmarks. CLIN can also transfer its learning to new environments and tasks, enhancing performance by 21 points in ScienceWorld and 11 points in ALFWorld.

AgentKit offers a unified framework for explicitly constructing a complex ""thought process"" from simple natural language prompts.

The user then puts together chains of nodes, in order to build a ""thought process"" for any problem, like stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be designed to explicitly enforce a naturally **structured** ""thought process"". For example, for the task of writing a paper, one may start with the thought process of 1) identify a core message, 2) identify prior research gaps, etc.
The nodes in AgentKit can be designed and combined in different ways to implement multiple advanced capabilities including on-the-fly hierarchical planning, reflection, and learning from interactions. 
In addition, due to the modular nature and the intuitive design to simulate explicit human thought process, a basic agent could be implemented as simple as a list of prompts for the subtasks and therefore could be designed and tuned by someone *without any programming experience*.

GPT-4, the recent breakthrough in large language models (LLMs) trained on massive passive data, is notable for its knowledge retrieval and reasoning abilities. This paper delves into the applicability of GPT-4's learned knowledge for imperfect information games. 
To achieve this, we introduce \textbf{\agentname{}}, an innovative agent that leverages GPT-4's capabilities for imperfect information games. With proper prompt engineering to achieve different functions, \agentname{} based on GPT-4 demonstrates remarkable adaptability across a range of imperfect information card games.

In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game includes the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales.

We hypothesize that psychologically grounded principles could enable such advanced psychology capabilities in LLMs, and design RESORT which consists of a series of reappraisal constitutions across multiple dimensions that can be used as LLM instructions.

However, we observe that recent LLMs can easily suffer from hallucinations on highly specialized and fast-evolving themes (e.g., redox-active organic electrode materials), especially in the following cases: (1) unseen entities: an entity never appears in the pre-training corpora of LLMs; and (2) misleading semantics: the context of an entity can potentially mislead an entity typing algorithm if the relevant knowledge is not correctly retrieved and utilized. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Ontology-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ORAG) approach that incorporates ontology structures with RAG for the theme-specific entity typing task. ORAG first enriches the label ontology with external knowledge and constructs a structured knowledge unit for each node. Then, it retrieves the relevant nodes by dense passage retrieval and expands the retrieved results based on the ontological structure. In this way, more supporting knowledge will be retrieved within the limited input of LLMs for entity typing. In the evaluation, we construct a dataset with two themes for theme-specific entity typing with a focus on unseen entities and misleading semantics. We observe notable cases of hallucination when vanilla RAG is applied to Llama-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, while ORAG can effectively mitigate such hallucinations and improve the results.",,,"Jinfeng Xiao, Linyi Ding, James Barry, Mohab Elkaref, Geeth De Mel, Jiawei Han",,Sub,

To this end, we propose symbolically grounded generation (SymGen) as a simple approach for enabling easier manual validation of an LLMs output. SymGen prompts an LLM to interleave its regular output text with explicit symbolic references to fields present in some conditioning data (e.g., a table in JSON format). The references can be used to display the provenance of different spans of text in the generation, reducing the effort required for manual verification. Across a range of data-to-text and question-answering exper- iments, we find that LLMs are able to directly output text that makes use of accurate symbolic references while maintaining fluency and factuality.

We introduce a principle-based teacher-student framework called Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD) to address these limitations. Inspired by human learning mechanisms, TPD mimics the interaction between a teacher and a student using a principle-based approach. The teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM's errors. These principles guide the refinement of instructions and the selection of instructive examples from a validation set. This enables the student model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes. Once the student model begins making inferences, TPD requires no further intervention from the teacher LLM. Through extensive experiments across eight reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TPD.

Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on time-series captioning tasks, potentially masking MLLMs' performance challenges such as hallucination in long-context situations.

We define construct validity for text-image consistency metrics as a set of desiderata that text-image consistency metrics should have, and find that no tested metric satisfies all of them. We find that metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to language and visual properties. Next, we find that TIFA, VPEval and DSG contribute novel information above and beyond CLIPScore, but also that they correlate highly with each other. We also ablate different aspects of the text-image consistency metrics and find that not all model components are strictly necessary, also a symptom of insufficient sensitivity to visual information.

One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' - subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' - the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology.

Most studies determine which edges belong in a LM's circuit for a task by performing causal interventions on each edge independently, but this scales poorly with model size. As a solution, recent work has proposed edge attribution patching (EAP), a scalable gradient-based approximation to interventions. In this paper, we introduce a new method - EAP with integrated gradients (EAP-IG) - that aims to efficiently find circuits while better maintaining one of their core properties: faithfulness. A circuit is faithful if all model edges outside the circuit can be ablated without changing the model's behavior on the task; faithfulness is what justifies studying circuits, rather than the full model. Our experiments demonstrate that circuits found using EAP-IG are more faithful than those found using EAP, even though both have high node overlap with reference circuits found using causal interventions. We conclude more generally that when comparing circuits, measuring overlap is no substitute for measuring faithfulness.",,,"Michael Hanna, Sandro Pezzelle, Yonatan Belinkov",,Sub,

Rethinking How Large Language Models Respond and Solve Tasks via In-Context Learning,Poster #40,"In-context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability alongside the development of scaled-up large language models (LLMs). By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. We then demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate that retrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model's discriminative capability. However, we also observe a trade-off in selecting good in-context examples regarding label diversity.",,,"Quanyu Long, Yin Wu, Wenya Wang, Sinno Jialin Pan",,Sub,

However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages.
In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions.
We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions.
Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context.
Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading content. 
Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robustness of LLMs to such distractions.

While safety fine-tuning typically takes place in English, if at all, these models are being used by speakers of many different languages. There is existing evidence that the performance of these models is inconsistent across languages and that they discriminate based on demographic factors of the user. Motivated by this, we investigate whether the social stereotypes exhibited by LLMs differ as a function of the language used to prompt them, while controlling for cultural differences and task accuracy. To this end, we present MBBQ (Multilingual Bias Benchmark for Question-answering), a carefully curated version of the English BBQ dataset extended to Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish, which measures stereotypes
commonly held across these languages. We further complement MBBQ with a parallel control dataset to measure task performance on the question-answering task independently of bias. Our results based on several open-source and proprietary LLMs confirm that some non-English languages suffer from bias more than English, even when controlling for cultural shifts.

However, these auto-annotators can introduce complex biases that are hard to remove. Even simple, known confounders such as preference for longer outputs remains in existing automated evaluation metrics.
We propose a simple regression analysis approach for controlling biases in auto-evaluations. 
As a real case study, we focus on reducing the length bias of AlpacaEval, a fast and affordable benchmark for instruction-following LLMs that uses LLMs to estimate response quality.
Despite being highly correlated with human preferences, AlpacaEval is known to favor models that generate longer outputs.
We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: ""What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?"" 
To achieve this, we first fit a GLM to predict the biased output of interest (auto-annotator preferences) based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. 
We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths.

Although DPO has rapidly gained popularity due to its straightforward training process and competitive results, there is an open question of whether there remain practical advantages of using a discriminator, such as a reward model, to evaluate responses. We propose D2PO, discriminator-guided DPO, an approach for the online setting where preferences are being collected throughout learning. As we collect gold preferences, we use these not only to train our policy, but to train a discriminative response evaluation model to silver-label even more synthetic data for policy training. We explore this approach across a set of diverse tasks, including a realistic chat setting, and we find that our approach can lead to higher-quality outputs compared to DPO with the same data budget, and greater efficiency in terms of preference data requirements.

In this work, we study to what extent a malicious actor can manipulate the LMs generations by poisoning the preferences, i.e., injecting poisonous preference pairs into these datasets and the RLHF training process. We propose strategies to build poisonous preference pairs and test their performance by poisoning two widely used preference datasets. Our results show that preference poisoning is highly effective: injecting a small amount of poisonous data (1-5\% of the original dataset), we can effectively manipulate the LM to generate a target entity in a target sentiment (positive or negative).

Specifically, we derive detoxification vectors from self-induced, universal steering pairs through arithmetic operations in activation spaces. During inference, detoxification is achieved by fusing the detoxification vectors with the original representations in a head-wise manner. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on various metrics, while also maintaining satisfactory generation quality and diversity.

As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent and integrated into autonomous systems, ensuring their safety is imperative. Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete tokens optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps.
Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100\% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. 
More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99\% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5.
To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. Impressively, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend.",,,"Zeyi Liao, Huan Sun",,Sub,

In this work we show that, with only a conservative assumption about the model architecture, it is possible to learn a surprisingly large amount of non-public information about an API-protected LLM from a relatively small number of API queries (e.g., costing under $1000 USD for OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo). Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLMs hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAIs gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096. Lastly, we discuss ways that LLM providers can guard against these attacks, as well as how these capabilities can be viewed as a feature (rather than a bug) by allowing for greater transparency and accountability.",,,"Matthew Finlayson, Xiang Ren, Swabha Swayamdipta",,Sub,

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5x higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

In this paper, we show how language models can be taught to search by representing the process of search in language, as a flattened string --- stream of search (SoS). We propose a unified language for search that captures an array of different symbolic search strategies. We demonstrate our approach using the simple yet difficult game of Countdown, where the goal is to combine input numbers with arithmetic operations to reach a target number. We pretrain a transformer-based language model from scratch on a dataset of streams of search generated by heuristic solvers. We find that SoS pretraining increases search accuracy by 25\% over models trained to predict only the optimal search trajectory.  We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36\% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers.

Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs,Main Hall,"Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.",,,"Pengda Wang, Zilin Xiao, Hanjie Chen, Frederick L.

This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a *purely* length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data.",,,"Prasann Singhal, Tanya Goyal, Jiacheng Xu, Greg Durrett",,Sub,

Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up-to-date information. However, a reported cutoff only scratches the surface. Do all sub-resources in the training data share the same cutoff? Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these sub-resources closely align to their cutoff? We define the notion of an effective cutoff, which is distinct from the LLM's reported cutoff and differs between sub-resources. We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs of an LLM on the resource-level by probing across versions of the data. Crucially, our method does not require access to a model's pre-training data. Through our analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often drastically differ from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal misalignments of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps; and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use these models.",,,"Jeffrey Cheng, Marc Marone, Orion Weller, Dawn Lawrie, Daniel Khashabi, Benjamin Van Durme",,Sub,

To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks. However, prior benchmarks contain only a very limited set of problems, both in quantity and variety. Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To address this, we introduce EvoEval  a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition.

However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa.

10/8/2024,10:45AM,11:00AM,,GeniL: A Multilingual Dataset on Generalizing Language,Main Hall,"Generative language models are increasingly transforming our digital ecosystem, but they often inherit societal biases learned from their training data, for instance stereotypes associating certain attributes with specific identity groups. While whether and how these biases are mitigated may depend on the specific use cases, being able to effectively detect instances of stereotype perpetuation is a crucial first step. Current methods to assess presence of stereotypes in generated language rely on simple template or co-occurrence based measures, without accounting for the variety of sentential contexts they manifest in. We argue that the sentential context is crucial to determine if the co-occurrence of an identity term and an attribute is an instance of generalization. We distinguish two types of generalizations ---(1) where the language merely mentions the presence of a generalization (e.g., ""people think the French are very rude""), and (2) where the language reinforces such a generalization (e.g., ""as French they must be rude""---, from a non-generalizing context (e.g., ""My French friends think I am rude""). 
For meaningful stereotype evaluations, we need scalable ways to reliably detect and distinguish such instances of generalizations.
To address this gap, we introduce the new task of detecting generalization in language, and build GeniL, a multilingual dataset of over 50K sentences from 9 languages ---English, Arabic, Bengali, Spanish, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Malay, and Portuguese--- annotated for instances of generalizations and their types. We demonstrate that the likelihood of a co-occurrence being an instance of generalization is usually low, and varies across different languages, identity groups, and attributes, underscoring the inadequacy of simplistic co-occurrence based approaches. We also build classifiers that can detect generalization in language with an overall PR-AUC of 58.7, with varying degrees of performance across languages. Our research provides data and tools to enable a nuanced understanding of stereotype perpetuation, a crucial step towards more inclusive and responsible language technologies.",,,"Aida Mostafazadeh Davani, Sagar Gubbi Venkatesh, Sunipa Dev, Shachi Dave, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran",,Sub,

10/8/2024,03:30PM,03:45PM,,AI-generated text boundary detection with RoFT,Main Hall,"Due to the rapid development of large language models, people increasingly often encounter texts that may start as written by a human but continue as machine-generated. Detecting the boundary between human-written and machine-generated parts of such texts is a challenging problem that has not received much attention in literature. We attempt to bridge this gap and examine several ways to adapt state of the art artificial text detection classifiers to the boundary detection setting. We push all detectors to their limits, using the Real or Fake text benchmark that contains short texts on several topics and includes generations of various language models. We use this diversity to deeply examine the robustness of all detectors in cross-domain and cross-model settings to provide baselines and insights for future research. In particular, we find that perplexity-based approaches to boundary detection tend to be more robust to peculiarities of domain-specific data than supervised fine-tuning of the RoBERTa model; we also find which features of the text confuse boundary detection algorithms and negatively influence their performance in cross-domain settings.",,,"Laida Kushnareva, Tatiana Gaintseva, Dmitry Abulkhanov, Kristian Kuznetsov, German Magai, Eduard Tulchinskii, Serguei Barannikov, Sergey Nikolenko, Irina Piontkovskaya",,Sub,
10/8/2024,03:45PM,04:00PM,,Measuring and Controlling Instruction (In)Stability in Language Model Dialogs,Main Hall,"System-prompting is a standard tool for customizing language-model chatbots, enabling them to follow a specific instruction. An implicit assumption in the use of system prompts is that they will be _stable_, so the chatbot will continue to generate text according to the stipulated instructions for the duration of a conversation. We propose a quantitative benchmark to test this assumption, evaluating instruction stability via self-chats between two instructed chatbots. Testing popular models like LLaMA2-chat-70B and GPT-3.5, we reveal a significant _instruction drift_ within eight rounds of conversations. An empirical and theoretical analysis of this phenomenon suggests the transformer attention mechanism plays a role, due to _attention decay_ over long exchanges. To combat attention decay and instruction drift, we propose a lightweight method called split-softmax, which compares favorably against two strong baselines.

We contribute VizWiz-LF, a dataset of long-form answers to visual questions posed by blind and low vision (BLV) users. VizWiz-LF contains 4.2k long-form answers to 600 visual questions, collected from human expert describers and six VQA models. We develop and annotate functional roles of sentences of LFVQA and demonstrate that long-form answers contain information beyond the question answer such as explanations and suggestions to retake photos. We further conduct automatic and human evaluations involving BLV and sighted people to evaluate long-form answers. While BLV people perceive both human-written and generated long-form answers as plausible, generated answers often hallucinate incorrect visual details, especially for unanswerable visual questions (e.g., blurry or irrelevant images). To reduce hallucinations, we evaluate VQA models on their ability to abstain from answering unanswerable questions.",,,"Mina Huh, Fangyuan Xu, Yi-Hao Peng, Chongyan Chen, Hansika Murugu, Danna Gurari, Eunsol Choi, Amy Pavel",,Sub,
10/8/2024,04:15PM,04:30PM,,Iteratively Prompting Multimodal LLMs to Reproduce Natural and AI-Generated Images,Main Hall,"With the digital imagery landscape rapidly evolving, image stocks and AI-generated image marketplaces have become central to visual media. Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney.  This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices (\$0.23 - \$0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Additionally, this approach holds promise as a tool for data augmentation, potentially enhancing machine learning models by providing varied and cost-effective training data. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million prompt-image pairs generated by the popular Midjourney platform, which we plan to release publicly.",,,"Ali Naseh, Katherine Thai, Mohit Iyyer, Amir Houmansadr",,Sub,

However, as context length increases, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory, becoming a bottleneck for deployment.
This paper introduces SKVQ (Sliding-window KV cache Quantization), a strategy designed to address the challenge of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache to enhance channel similarity within quantization groups and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Furthermore, SKVQ maintains high precision for the most recent window tokens in the KV cache, preserving accuracy for a small yet critical portion of the cache.
Our evaluation of LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy, outperforming previous quantization methods. SKVQ enables the quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal accuracy loss. This advancement allows processing context lengths of up to 1M tokens on an 80GB GPU for a 7B parameter model, resulting in up to 7 times faster decoding.",,,"Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng ZHANG, Dahua Lin",,Sub,
10/9/2024,10:15AM,10:30AM,,Tuning Language Models by Proxy,Main Hall,"Despite the general capabilities of large pretrained language models, they consistently benefit from further adaptation to better achieve desired behaviors. However, tuning these models has become increasingly resource-intensive, or impossible when model weights are private. We introduce **proxy-tuning**, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that operates on top of black-box LMs to achieve the same end as direct tuning, but by accessing only its predictions over the output vocabulary, not its parameters. Our method tunes a *smaller* LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the larger untuned model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger-scale pretraining. In experiments, when we apply proxy-tuning to Llama2-70B using proxies of only 7B size, we can close 88% of the gap between Llama2-70B and its truly-tuned chat version, when evaluated across knowledge, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. We then demonstrate the generality of proxy-tuning by applying it to domain adaptation on code, and task-specific finetuning on question-answering and math problems. Finally, we show how to proxy-tune a truly black-box LM, GPT-3.5, for temporal adaptation, increasing its knowledge about recent events. Our work demonstrates the promise of using small tuned LMs to efficiently customize large, potentially proprietary LMs through decoding-time guidance.",,,"Alisa Liu, Xiaochuang Han, Yizhong Wang, Yulia Tsvetkov, Yejin Choi, Noah A.

10/9/2024,10:30AM,10:45AM,,Auxiliary task demands mask the capabilities of smaller language models,Main Hall,"Developmental psychologists have argued about when cognitive capacities such as language understanding or theory of mind emerge. These debates often hinge on the concept of ""task demands"" -- the auxiliary challenges associated with performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the childs underlying ability. The same issues arise when measuring the capacities of language models (LMs): performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying knowledge, combined with the models ability to interpret and perform the task given its available resources. Here, we show that for analogical reasoning, reflective reasoning, word prediction, and grammaticality judgments, evaluation methods with greater task demands yield lower performance than evaluations with reduced demands. This ""demand gap"" is most pronounced for models with fewer parameters and less training data. Our results illustrate that LM performance should not be interpreted as a direct indication of intelligence (or lack thereof), but as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of researchers' design choices.",,,"Jennifer Hu, Michael Frank",,Sub,
10/9/2024,10:45AM,11:00AM,,Infini-gram: Scaling Unbounded n-gram Language Models to a Trillion Tokens,Main Hall,"Are $n$-gram language models still relevant in this era of neural large language models (LLMs)? Our answer is *yes*, and we showcase their values in both text analysis and improving neural LLMs. This was done by modernizing $n$-gram LMs in two aspects. First, we train them at the same data scale as neural LLMs -- **5 trillion tokens**. This is one of the largest $n$-gram LMs ever built. Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new **$\infty$-gram LM** with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with **millisecond-level latency**. The $\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine: $\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers.",,,"Jiacheng Liu, Sewon Min, Luke Zettlemoyer, Yejin Choi, Hannaneh Hajishirzi",,Sub,

10/9/2024,03:30PM,03:45PM,,Self-Taught Optimizer (STOP): Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation,Main Hall,"Several recent advances in AI systems solve problems by providing a ""scaffolding"" program that structures multiple calls to language models to generate better outputs. A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed ""improver"" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox.",,,"Eric Zelikman, Eliana Lorch, Lester Mackey, Adam Tauman Kalai",,Sub,

10/9/2024,04:00PM,04:15PM,,Transformer Circuit Evaluation Metrics Are Not Robust,Main Hall,"Mechanistic interpretability work attempts to reverse engineer the learned algorithms present inside neural networks. One focus of this work has been to discover 'circuits' - subgraphs of the full model that explain behaviour on specific tasks. But how do we measure the performance of such circuits? Prior work has attempted to measure circuit 'faithfulness' - the degree to which the circuit replicates the performance of the full model. In this work, we survey many considerations for designing experiments that measure circuit faithfulness by ablating portions of the model's computation. Concerningly, we find existing methods are highly sensitive to seemingly insignificant changes in the ablation methodology. We conclude that existing circuit faithfulness scores reflect _both_ the methodological choices of researchers as well as the actual components of the circuit - the task a circuit is required to perform depends on the ablation used to test it. The ultimate goal of mechanistic interpretability work is to understand neural networks, so we emphasize the need for more clarity in the precise claims being made about circuits. We open source a library at [this https URL](https://github.com/UFO-101/auto-circuit) that includes highly efficient implementations of a wide range of ablation methodologies and circuit discovery algorithms.",,,"Joseph Miller, Bilal Chughtai, William Saunders",,Sub,
